Package: aroma.apd
==================

Version: 0.2.5 [2013-05-25]
o Minor speedup by replacing rm() calls with NULL assignments. 


Version: 0.2.4 [2013-05-22]
o CRAN POLICY: Now all Rd \usage{} lines are at most 90 characters long.


Version: 0.2.3 [2012-06-30]
o Updated package dependencies.


Version: 0.2.2 [2012-04-04]
o Now package only imports R.methodsS3.


Version: 0.2.1 [2012-04-01]
o CLEANUP: Now package no longer gives an 'R CMD check' NOTE that
  .onAttach() tries to load the 'affxparser' package.


Version: 0.2.0 [2011-07-23]
o Now the package depends on R.huge v0.3.0, which now also
  has a namespace.


Version: 0.1.9 [2011-02-20]
o Now this package will try to install affxparser, if missing
  and in interactive mode.


Version: 0.1.8 [2011-01-31]
o Using packageStartupMessage() instead of cat().


Version: 0.1.7 [2009-10-16]
o Fixed a few broken Rd links to the affxparser package.


Version: 0.1.6 [2009-06-11]
o Made it explicit in the title and the description that this
  package should now be considered deprecated.


Version: 0.1.5 [2009-05-16]
o Updated {read|update|write}Apd() to coerce argument 'writeMap' to
  integer indices.  readApd() also corce argument 'indices' to the
  same.  Before it used to coerce to doubles, if using R.utils v1.1.4
  or before.  These updates should make no difference to anyone.
  The main purpose is just to use Arguments$getIndices() instead of
  Arguments$getNumerics() whereever possible.
o Fixed a syntax error in one Rdoc comment.
o Renamed the file HISTORY (this one) to NEWS.


Version: 0.1.4 [2007-05-24]
o Added a namespace to the package.


Version: 0.1.3 [2006-06-19]
o Forgot to use autoload("setMethodS3", package="R.oo") etc.
  Packaged would not install on Linux.


Version: 0.1.2 [2006-03-18]
o Added updateApdUnits(). 
o Now all probe indices are not longer zero-based but one-based.
  However, there is still an option to change this to zero-based
  indices again by using argument 'indexOffset=0'.  This option
  might be remove in the future, because zero-based indices are
  really confusing in R.


Version: 0.1.1 [2006-03-14]
o There is now a quite large set of methods to process APD files.
o All of the methods to re-arrange CDF structures and to create
  cell-index maps have been moved to the affxparser package.


Version: 0.1.0 [2006-02-23]
o Created.
