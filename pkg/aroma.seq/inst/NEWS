Package: aroma.seq
==================

Version: 0.4.2 [2013-11-18]
o Added support for FastaReferenceFile$byOrganism(..., prefix),
  making it possible to distinguish between multiple FASTA files
  for the same organism.
o The default method for building BWA indices is now 'bwtsw', because
  contrary to the previous default ('is'), the new one supports larger
  genomes as well (such as the human genome) and will always work.  It
  is useful to understand that regardless of choice, the generated
  index sets are always identical across building methods.  There is 
  a package system test asserting this fact.
o ROBUSTNESS: Now buildBwaIndexSet(..., method="is") checks for maximum
  size of reference genome (2GB) and gives an informative error if the
  FASTA file is greater.
o BUG FIX: BwaIndexSet$byPrefix(prefix) would find any BWA index set
  in directory dirname(prefix) without matching filenames of the set
  to basename(prefix).


Version: 0.4.1 [2013-11-16]
o Added QDNAseqEstimation, which is utilized by doQDNAseq() methods.

  automatically enabled if a .BatchJobs.R file exists in the
  current working directory when 'aroma.seq' is attached.


Version: 0.3.6 [2013-11-14]
o Added sortByPosition() for BamDataFile/BamDataSet.


Version: 0.3.5 [2013-11-12]

o For now FASTA files should be non-compressed in order to
  work will all third-party tools.


Version: 0.3.4 [2013-11-11]
o SPEEDUP: Now Bowtie2Alignment and BwaAlignment skip already processed
  items much faster and if all are done, even quicker.

Version: 0.3.3 [2013-11-10]
o Started to add support for custom directory structures.


Version: 0.3.2 [2013-11-09]
o Added static byName() for FastqDataSet, BamDataSet and SamDataSet.
o Added FastaReferenceFile$byOrganism().
o Now all package system tests use byName() instead of byPath().
o Now all input and output paths contains the organims name, e.g.
  fastqData/<dataSet>/<organism>/.  Placeholder "Generic" is no
  longer used for <organism>.
o Added getOrganism() for BamDataSet, SamDataSet, and FastqDataSet.


Version: 0.3.1 [2013-11-08]

  with BatchJobs and other parallel backends.
o Now FastqDataFile|Set handles more paired filename formats.
o SPEEDUP: Parallelized BinnedGcNormalization.
o ROBUSTNESS: Added package system test for BinnedGcNormalization.
o BUG FIX: normalizeGcContent() assumed that 'aroma.light' was attached.


Version: 0.2.37 [2013-11-01]
o SPEEDUP: Parallized TopHat2Alignment.  Added system test.
o SPEEDUP: Now process() for TopHat2Alignment skips already
  processed samples.

o Added getMateFile() for FastqDataFile.


Version: 0.2.23 [2013-08-22]
o BUG FIX: Read Group options ('--rg' and '--rg-id') passed to 'bowtie2'
  by the Bowtie2Aligment class did not have the preceeding '--'.


Version: 0.2.22 [2013-08-22]

o Now all NnnAlignment methods outputs to root directory 'bamData/'.
o BUG FIX: Now Bowtie2Alignment handles if there are commas in the
  pathname of the FASTQ file by using a tempory file link without
  commas.  This is needed because the bowtie2 executable does not
  support commas.
o ROBUSTNESS: Added several system tests.
o Added annotationData/ and fastqData/ under package's exData/.

Version: 0.2.12 [2013-06-27]
o GENERALIZATION: Now FastqDataFile can also hold a gzipped file.
  If so, then certain properties of the file is not parsed, e.g.
  number of sequences.  However, the file can still be passed on
  to for instance aligners that support gzipped files out of the
  box, e.g. BwaAlignment.
o Now process() for Bowtie2Aligment temporarily decompresses
  gzipped FASTQ files in case the installed bowtie2 does not
  support gzip files.
o BUG FIX: buildBowtie2IndexSet() for FastaReferenceFile became broken
  after updates in systemBowtie2Build().

Version: 0.2.1 [2012-11-26]
o SPEEDUP: process(..., dropEmpty=TRUE) for GatkAlleleCounting
  is now much faster.
o ROBUSTNESS: Now convertToBamDataSet() for SamDataSet asserts
  that the output set is complete.
o BUG FIX: process() for BwaAlignment and Bowtie2Alignment was
  only align the first sample regardless on input data set.
  This bug was introduced in aroma.seq v0.1.27.
o BUG FIX: getOutputDataSet() for AbstractAlignment and
  PicardDuplicateRemoval could return data sets with "missing"
  files, if the method was not completed.  Now they only
  returns the existing output files.


Version: 0.2.0 [2012-11-21]
o Updated verbose output of parameters.


Version: 0.1.29 [2012-11-21]
o Now applicable classes utilize the new ParametersInterface.
o DOCUMENTATION: Hiding more internal methods from the help indices.


Version: 0.1.27 [2012-11-12]
o CLEANUP: Now seq_along(x) instead of seq(along=x) everywhere.
  Similarly, seq(ds) where 'ds' is GenericDataFileSet is now
  replaced by seq_along(ds).  Likewise, seq_len(x) replaces
  seq(length=x), and length(ds) replaces nbrOfFiles(ds).


Version: 0.1.26 [2012-11-09]
o Added argument 'dropEmpty' to GatkAlleleCounting, which will drop
  all SNPs with zero coverage from the output files making the
  smaller and faster to read, particularly for low coverage samples.


Version: 0.1.25 [2012-11-08]
o Implemented getOutputDataSet() for GatkAlleleCounting, which
  returns a TabularTextFileSet.


Version: 0.1.24 [2012-11-08]
o Renamed getColumnNames() to getDefaultColumnNames() for all
  classes inheriting from GenericTabularFile, because of the
  new ColumnNamesInterface interface.


Version: 0.1.23 [2012-11-02]
o Now process() for GatkAlleleCounting outputs cleaner files.


Version: 0.1.22 [2012-10-31]

  containing the positions of Chr1-25 SNPs of a SNP135 BED file.


Version: 0.1.21 [2012-10-30]
o Added validate() for BamDataFile.


Version: 0.1.20 [2012-10-29]
o CLEANUP: Now using Arguments$get(Read|Writ)ablePath() instead of
  filePath(..., expandLinks="any").


Version: 0.1.19 [2012-10-21]
o ROBUSTNESS: Now using Arguments$getWritablePath() everywhere instead
  of mkdirs(), because the former will do a better job in creating
  and asserting directories on slow shared file systems, and when it
  fails it gives a more informative error message.
o FIX: Now BwaAligment will use a default SAM read group ID of 1
  (cf. Picard AddOrReplaceReadGroups) if missing.  Previously it
  gave an error instead.


Version: 0.1.18 [2012-10-18]
o Added trial version of BinnedGcNormalization.


Version: 0.1.17 [2012-10-17]
o ROBUSTNESS: Now binTabulate(seq, ...) also handles the case where
  sequence 'seq' is offsetted, i.e. starts at a different position
  than the first one.


Version: 0.1.16 [2012-10-16]
o Added AromaUnitNucleotideCountsFile and methods for importing
  binned nucleotide counts from a BSgenome object.
o Added binTabulate() for MaskedDNAString.
o ROBUSTNESS/BUG FIX: No longer passing '...' to NextMethod(), cf.
  R-devel thread 'Do *not* pass '...' to NextMethod() - it'll do it
  for you; missing documentation, a bug or just me?' on Oct 16, 2012.


Version: 0.1.15 [2012-10-11]

o Added IlluminaFastqData(File|Set), which is aware of Illumina
  specific filenames and sequence information.
o Now BwaAlignment and Bowtie2Alignment inherits AbstactAlignment
  and both write SAM read groups, if available/provided.
