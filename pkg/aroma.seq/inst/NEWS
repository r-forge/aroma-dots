Package: aroma.seq
==================

Version: 0.1.23 [2012-11-02]
o Now process() for GatkAlleleCounting outputs cleaner files.


Version: 0.1.22 [2012-10-31]
o Added GatkAlleleCounting.
o Added anyDuplicated() and writeBedDataFile() for AromaUgpFile.
o Added buildIndex() for FastaReferenceFile for building FAI index files.
o Added buildScripts/.  First script is creating an Aroma UGP file
  containing the positions of Chr1-25 SNPs of a SNP135 BED file.


Version: 0.1.21 [2012-10-30]
o Added validate() for BamDataFile.


Version: 0.1.20 [2012-10-29]
o CLEANUP: Now using Arguments$get(Read|Writ)ablePath() instead of
  filePath(..., expandLinks="any").


Version: 0.1.19 [2012-10-21]
o ROBUSTNESS: Now using Arguments$getWritablePath() everywhere instead
  of mkdirs(), because the former will do a better job in creating
  and asserting directories on slow shared file systems, and when it
  fails it gives a more informative error message.
o FIX: Now BwaAligment will use a default SAM read group ID of 1
  (cf. Picard AddOrReplaceReadGroups) if missing.  Previously it
  gave an error instead.


Version: 0.1.18 [2012-10-18]
o Added trial version of BinnedGcNormalization.


Version: 0.1.17 [2012-10-17]
o ROBUSTNESS: Now binTabulate(seq, ...) also handles the case where
  sequence 'seq' is offsetted, i.e. starts at a different position
  than the first one.


Version: 0.1.16 [2012-10-16]
o Added AromaUnitNucleotideCountsFile and methods for importing
  binned nucleotide counts from a BSgenome object.
o Added binTabulate() for MaskedDNAString.
o ROBUSTNESS/BUG FIX: No longer passing '...' to NextMethod(), cf.
  R-devel thread 'Do *not* pass '...' to NextMethod() - it'll do it 
  for you; missing documentation, a bug or just me?' on Oct 16, 2012.  


Version: 0.1.15 [2012-10-11]
o Added TotalCnBinnedCounting().


Version: 0.1.14 [2012-10-10]
o Added argument 'which' to readDataFrame() for BamDataFile.


Version: 0.1.13 [2012-10-02]
o Added getIndexStats(), nbrOfReads(), ... for BamDataFile:s.
o Added readDataFrame() for BamDataFile.
o Added PicardDuplicateRemoval.
o BUG FIX: systemSamtools(), systemJava() and systemBWA() did
  not handle cases with only non-named arguments.


Version: 0.1.12 [2012-10-01]
o Added IlluminaFastqData(File|Set), which is aware of Illumina
  specific filenames and sequence information.
o Now BwaAlignment and Bowtie2Alignment inherits AbstactAlignment
  and both write SAM read groups, if available/provided.
o Package now utilizes the ShortRead package.


Version: 0.1.11 [2012-09-28]
o Added getReadGroups() and replaceAllReadGroups() for BamDataFile.
o Added SamReadGroup() class.
o Added buildIndex() for BamDataFile.
o Added low-level support for GATK.


Version: 0.1.10 [2012-09-27]
o Added low-level support for Picard.


Version: 0.1.9 [2012-09-27]
o Added Bowtie2Alignment.


Version: 0.1.8 [2012-09-27]
o Added setupTests(aroma.seq) for easy setup of a redundancyTests/ directory.


Version: 0.1.7 [2012-09-25]
o Added capabilitiesOf(aroma.seq).
o Now a SamDataSet can be converted to a BamDataSet.
o Added BwaAlignment.
o Added BamDataFile and BamDataSet classes.
o Added BamData(File|Set) classes, cf. SamData(File|Set).
o Added BwaIndex(File|Set) classes for holding BWA index sets.


Version: 0.1.6 [2012-09-24]
o Added buildBwaIndexSet() for FastaReferenceFile.
o Added low-level support for BWA index, aln and samse.


Version: 0.1.5 [2012-08-31]
o TESTING: Added some test scripts for running bowtie2 at
  the shell and at the system level.


Version: 0.1.4 [2012-08-22]
o ...


Version: 0.1.3 [2012-08-21]
o Add systemBowtie2Build and testSystemBowtie2Build.


Version: 0.1.2 [2012-08-20]
o TYPO: Renamed Bowtie2Aligment to Bowtie2Alignment. 


Version: 0.1.1 [2012-07-11]
o Added a bowtie2() function stub.


Version: 0.1.0 [2012-06-28]
o Added BowtieAlignment.
o Added BamDataFile and BamDataSet.
o Added FastqDataFile and FastqDataSet.
o Added FastaReferenceFile.


Version: 0.0.1 [2012-06-28]
o Created. Just a stub.
