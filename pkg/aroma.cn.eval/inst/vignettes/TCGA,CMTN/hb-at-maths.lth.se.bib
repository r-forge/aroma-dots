  abstract = {Affymetrix high-density oligonucleotide array is a tool that has the
	capacity to simultaneously measure the abundance of thousands of
	mRNA sequences in biological samples. In order to allow direct array-to-array
	comparisons, normalization is a necessity. When deciding on an appropriate
	normalization procedure there are a couple questions that need to
	be addressed, e.g., on which level should the normalization be performed:
	On the level of feature intensities or on the level of expression
	indexes? Should all features/expression indexes be used or can we
	choose a subset of features likely to be unregulated? Another question
	is how to actually perform the normalization: normalize using the
	overall mean intensity or use a smooth normalization curve? Most
	of the currently used normalization methods are linear; e.g., the
	normalization method implemented in the Affymetrix software GeneChip
	is based on the overall mean intensity. However, along with alternative
	methods of summarizing feature intensities into an expression index,
	nonlinear methods have recently started to appear. For many of these
	alternative methods, the natural choice is to normalize on the level
	of feature intensities, either using all feature intensities or only
	perfect match intensities. In this report, a nonlinear normalization
	procedure aimed for normalizing feature intensities is proposed.},

  institution = {Affymetrix Inc.},
  year = {2009},
  type = {White Paper},
  month = {May},
  abstract = {A technical genome-wide artifact known as GC wave or waviness is a
	common, systematic issue observed with whole-genome assays. GC waviness
	occurs independently of array platform and has been observed by researchers
	using the Illumina HumanHap550 Genotyping BeadChip, array comparative
	genomic hybridization (CGH), whole-genome tiling arrays, and the
	Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0.
	
	
	In general, the waviness is highly correlated with the GC content
	of a genomic region. In Genotyping Console™ (GTC) Software 2.0/2.1/3.0,
	the copy number (CN) algorithm does not account for the GC content.
	This wavy artifact (waviness) affects log2 ratio calculation; therefore,
	
	affected samples may have higher false positive rates for predictions
	of both duplications and deletions.
	
	
	In GTC 3.0.1/3.0.2, a correction method based on smoothing has been
	developed to address this issue. This CN algorithm correction reduces
	or removes the waviness effect across all chromosomes for most of
	the samples tested in this white paper, thereby reducing the number
	of false positive CN segments reported. This adjustment to the algorithm
	does not introduce a higher false negative rate, and the majority
	of abnormalities in samples are consistently reported independent
	of the GC waviness correction.},

  title = {Statistics in Genetics - Lecture Notes},
  note = {Mathematical Statistics, Centre for Mathematical Sciences, Lund University},
  month = {Nov},
  year = {2003},
  abstract = {These lecture notes are intended to give an overview of statistical
	methods employed
	
	for localization of genes that are involved in the causal pathway
	of human diseases.
	
	Thus the applications are mainly within human genetics and various
	experimental
	
	design techniques employed in animal genetics are not discussed.
	
	The statistical foundations to gene mapping were laid already until
	the 1950s.
	
	Several simple Mendelian traits have been mapped since then and the
	responsible
	
	gene cloned. However, much remains to be known about the genetic components
	
	of more complex diseases (such as schizophrenia, adult diabetes and
	hypertension).
	
	Since the early 1980s, a large set of genetic markers has been discovered,
	e.g. restriction
	
	fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms
	
	(SNPs). In conjunction with algorithmic advances, this has enabled
	more sophisticated
	
	mapping techniques, which can handle many markers and/or large pedigrees.
	
	Further, the completion of the human genome project (Lander et al.
	2001), (Venter
	
	et al. 2001) has made it possible with automated genotyping. All these
	facts together
	
	imply that 'statistics in gene mapping' is still a very active research
	eld.
	
	Our main focus is on statistical techniques, whereas the biological
	and genetics
	
	material is less detailed. For readers who wish to get a broader understanding
	of the
	
	subject, we refer to a textbook covering gene mapping of (human) diseases,
	e.g. Haines
	
	and Pericak-Vance (1998). Further, more details on statistical aspects
	of linkage
	
	and association analysis can be found in Ott (1999), Sham (1998),
	Lynch and Walsh
	
	(1997) and Terwillinger and G\"{o}ring (2000).
	
	Some prior knowledge of probability or inference theory is useful
	when reading
	
	the lecture notes. Although all statistics concepts used are dened
	`from scratch',
	
	some familiarity with basic calculus is helpful to get a deeper understanding
	of the
	
	material.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We have developed genomic tools to allow the genus Populus
	(aspens and cottonwoods) to be exploited as a full-featured model
	for investigating fundamental aspects of tree biology. We have undertaken
	large-scale expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing programs and
	created Populus microarrays with significant gene coverage. One of
	the important aspects of plant biology that cannot be studied in
	annual plants is the gene activity involved in the induction of autumn
	leaf senescence. RESULTS: On the basis of 36,354 Populus ESTs, obtained
	from seven cDNA libraries, we have created a DNA microarray consisting
	of 13,490 clones, spotted in duplicate. Of these clones, 12,376 (92\%)
	were confirmed by resequencing and all sequences were annotated and
	functionally classified. Here we have used the microarray to study
	transcript abundance in leaves of a free-growing aspen tree (Populus
	tremula) in northern Sweden during natural autumn senescence. Of
	the 13,490 spotted clones, 3,792 represented genes with significant
	expression in all leaf samples from the seven studied dates. CONCLUSIONS:
	We observed a major shift in gene expression, coinciding with massive
	chlorophyll degradation, that reflected a shift from photosynthetic
	competence to energy generation by mitochondrial respiration, oxidation
	of fatty acids and nutrient mobilization. Autumn senescence had much
	in common with senescence in annual plants; for example many proteases
	were induced. We also found evidence for increased transcriptional
	activity before the appearance of visible signs of senescence, presumably
	preparing the leaf for degradation of its components.},

	for the detection of copy number changes using Affymetrix Human Genome
	U133 Plus 2.0 arrays, starting with as little as 5 ng input genomic
	DNA. An analytical approach was developed using DNA isolated from
	cell lines containing various X-chromosome numbers, and validated
	with DNA from cell lines with defined deletions and amplifications
	in other chromosomal locations. We applied this method to examine
	the copy number changes in DNA from 5 frozen gastrointestinal stromal
	tumors (GIST). We detected known copy number aberrations consistent
	with previously published results using conventional or BAC-array
	CGH, as well as novel changes in GIST tumors. These changes were
	concordant with results from Affymetrix 100K human SNP mapping arrays.
	Gene expression data for these GIST samples had previously been generated
	on U133A arrays, allowing us to explore correlations between chromosomal
	copy number and RNA expression levels. One of the novel aberrations
	identified in the GIST samples, a previously unreported gain on 1q21.1
	containing the PEX11B gene, was confirmed in this study by FISH and
	was also shown to have significant differences in expression pattern
	when compared to a control sample. In summary, we have demonstrated
	the use of gene expression microarrays for the detection of genomic
	copy number aberrations in tumor samples. This method may be used
	to study copy number changes in other species for which RNA expression
	arrays are available, e.g. other mammals, plants, etc., and for which

  abstract = {SNP arrays provide reliable genotypes and can detect chromosomal aberrations
	at a high resolution. However, tissue heterogeneity is currently
	a major limitation for somatic tissue analysis. We have developed
	SOMATICs, an original program for accurate analysis of heterogeneous
	tissue samples. Fifty-four samples (42 tumors and 12 normal tissues)
	were processed through Illumina Beadarrays and then analyzed with
	SOMATICs. We demonstrate that tissue heterogeneity-related limitations
	not only can be overcome but can also be turned into an advantage.
	First, admixture of normal cells with tumor can be used as an internal
	reference, thereby enabling highly sensitive detection of somatic
	deletions without having corresponding normal tissue. Second, the
	presence of normal cells allows for discrimination of somatic from
	germline aberrations, and the proportion of cells in the tissue sample
	that are harboring the somatic events can be assessed. Third, relatively
	early versus late somatic events can also be distinguished, assuming
	that late events occur only in subsets of cancer cells. Finally,
	admixture by normal cells allows inference of germline genotypes
	from a cancer sample. All this information can be obtained from any
	cancer sample containing a proportion of 40-75\% of cancer cells.
	SOMATICs is a ready-to-use open-source program that integrates all
	of these features into a simple format, comprehensively describing

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Cancer is a multigenic disease resulting from both germline
	susceptibility and somatic events. While studying loss of heterozygosity
	(LOH) in cancer tissues, we anecdotally observed a low frequency
	of heterozygosity in cancer patients compared with controls, raising
	the question whether homozygosity could play a role in cancer predisposition.
	OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of germline homozygosity in
	a large series of patients with 3 different types of solid tumors
	compared with population-based controls. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS:
	Germline and corresponding tumor DNA isolated from 385 patients with
	carcinomas (147 breast, 116 prostate, and 122 head and neck carcinomas)
	were subjected to whole genome (345-microsatellite marker) LOH analysis.
	MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of homozygosity at microsatellite
	markers in cancer cases vs controls and frequency of somatic LOH
	in cancers at loci with the highest homozygosity. RESULTS: We identified
	16 loci in common among the 3 cancer types, with significantly increased
	germline homozygosity frequencies in the cancer patients compared
	with controls (P < .001). In the cases who happened to be germline
	heterozygous at these 16 loci, we found a mean (SD) LOH frequency
	of 58\% (4.2\%) compared with 50\% (7.5\%) at 197 markers without
	increased germline homozygosity (P < .001). Across the genome, this
	relationship holds as well (r = 0.46; 95\% confidence interval, 0.37-0.53;
	P < .001). We validated the association of specific loci with high
	germline homozygosity frequencies in an independent, single-nucleotide
	polymorphism-based, public data set of 205 lung carcinomas from white
	individuals (P < .05 to P < .001) as well as the correlation between
	genome-wide germline homozygosity and LOH frequencies (r = 0.21;
	95\% confidence interval, 0.18-0.24; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: In our
	study of 4 different types of solid tumors (our data for 3 types
	validated in a fourth type), increased germline homozygosity occurred
	at specific loci. When the germline was heterozygous at these loci,
	high frequencies of LOH/allelic imbalance occurred at these loci
	in the corresponding carcinomas.},

	The ability to compare and assess such algorithms is crucial for
	any downstream analysis. In this work, we suggest a methodology for
	comparing different signal quantitation algorithms for gene expression
	data. Our aim is to enable researchers to compare the effect of different
	SQ algorithms on the specific dataset they are dealing with. We combine
	two kinds of tests to assess the effect of an SQ algorithm in terms
	of signal to noise ratio. To assess noise, we exploit redundancy
	within the experimental dataset to test the variability of a given
	SQ algorithm output. For the effect of the SQ on the signal we evaluate
	the overabundance of differentially expressed genes using various
	statistical significance tests. RESULTS: We demonstrate our analysis
	approach with three SQ algorithms for oligonucleotide microarrays.
	We compare the results of using the dChip software and the RMAExpress
	software to the ones obtained by using the standard Affymetrix MAS5
	on a dataset containing pairs of repeated hybridizations. Our analysis
	suggests that dChip is more robust and stable than the MAS5 tools
	for about 60\% of the genes while RMAExpress is able to achieve an
	even greater improvement in terms of signal to noise, for more than

	Genomic Hybridization (CGH) were selected for further evaluation.
	For the 22 clinico-pathological entities with more than 50 cases,
	summary profiles for genomic imbalances were generated from case
	specific data and analyzed. RESULTS: With large variation in overall
	genomic instability, recurring genomic gains and losses were prominent.
	Most entities showed frequent gains involving 8q2, while gains on
	20q, 1q, 3q, 5p, 7q and 17q were frequent in different entities.
	Loss "hot spots" included 3p, 4q, 13q, 17p and 18q among others.
	Related average imbalance patterns were found for clinically distinct

	a limited set of variously combined chromosomal imbalances may be
	typical for carcinogenesis. Focus on the respective regions should

	However, interpretation of these data and turning it into biologically
	meaningful knowledge can be challenging. Frequently the output of

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) is used
	to scan the entire genome for variations in DNA copy number. A central
	task in the analysis of aCGH data is the segmentation into groups
	of probes sharing the same DNA copy number. Some well known segmentation
	methods suffer from very long running times, preventing interactive
	data analysis. RESULTS: We suggest a new segmentation method based
	on wavelet decomposition and thresholding, which detects significant
	breakpoints in the data. Our algorithm is over 1000 times faster
	than leading approaches, with similar performance. Another key advantage
	of the proposed method is its simplicity and flexibility. Due to
	its intuitive structure, it can be easily generalized to incorporate
	several types of side information. Here, we consider two extensions
	which include side information indicating the reliability of each
	measurement, and compensating for a changing variability in the measurement
	noise. The resulting algorithm outperforms existing methods, both
	in terms of speed and performance, when applied on real high density
	CGH data. AVAILABILITY: Implementation is available under software

  journal = BMCBioinfo,
  year = {2006},
  volume = {7},
  number = {96},
  month = {feb},
  abstract = {Background: In an microarray experiment the difference in expression
	between genes on the same slide are up to 103 folded or more. At
	low expression, even a small error in the estimate will have great
	in uence on the final test and reference ratio. In addition to the
	true spot intensity the scanned signal consist of different kinds
	of noise, referred to as background, and in order to asses the true
	spot intensity the background must be subtracted. The standard method
	of estimating the background intensity is to assume it equal to the
	intensity between spots. In the literature, morphological opening
	has been suggested as one of the best methods to estimate this between
	spot intensity.
	
	
	Results: This paper examines fundamental properties of rank filter
	estimates including morphological filter estimates. The bias and
	variance of these filters are determined by the number of background
	pixels used and the pixel distribution.The rank filter algorithms
	are compared to methods available in the software Spot from CSIRO
	and GenePix by Axon Instruments. Morphological opening, in Spot,
	has a mean bias between -50 and -250 compared to a bias between 1
	and -2 for the rank filter and the variability of the morphological
	opening estimate is 3 times higher than for the rank filter. The
	mean bias of the second method in Spot, morphological close-opening,
	is between -5 and -15 and the variability is approximately the same
	as for morphological opening. The variability of the region based
	estimate of GenePix is ten times higher than the variability of the
	rank filter estimate and with slightly more bias. In addition to
	the GenePix estimate, a non-adaptive region based method is implemented.
	The bias and variability of this method is almost comparable to the
	rank filter.
	
	Conclusions: The performance of more advanced rank filters are equal
	to the best region based methods. However, great care must be taken
	when implementing these filters in order to get unbiased estimates.
	The performance of the previously suggested morphological opening
	is in general very poor with substantial spatial dependent bias.},

  abstract = {We have implemented a self-contained package for DNA microarray analysis
	in R. The package is named aroma and is formerly known as com.braju.sma.
	The purpose of the package is to provide end-users with easy access
	to the latest statistical tools and methods, to provide other statisticians
	with a structured platform to develop and test new analysis methods,
	and to make our methods available to an audience as broad as possible.
	In turn, this give us most valuable feedback for improving the package
	and its algorithms. The package provides methods for low-level analysis
	and pre-processing of spotted microarray data with two or more channels,
	although the recent methods are applicable to single-channel microarrays
	as well. Many of the commonly known and widely used normalization
	methods have been implemented as well as our own normalization and
	calibration methods in both early and mature versions. A few high-level
	analysis methods do exist. Import and export of microarray data is
	supported for most free and commercial file formats. Support for
	new ones can easily be added. Connectivity to other microarray analysis
	platforms based on relational databases is planned. For exploratory
	data analysis, the package provides a large set of methods for visualization
	of data with automatic graphical annotations. Textual and symbolic
	annotation of graphs is straightforward. Generated graphics can be
	exported for on-screen presentations and high-resolution printed
	publications. Report generators for simultaneously creating documents
	in plain text, HTML, and LaTeX are available, making it easy to create
	batch analysis scripts. Detailed documentation with code examples
	and references to the literature are included. In order to provide
	time and memory efficient algorithms, an object-oriented design and
	implementation utilizing reference variables has been used. In addition,
	to minimize the risk for programming mistakes, a consistent application
	protocol interface (API) was developed by enforcing an R coding convention.
	This will make it possible for a new user to quickly become familiar
	with the structure of classes and methods enhancing overall productivity.
	To further minimize the risk for programming errors, method arguments
	are validated as far as possible and explanatory error messages are
	used. Priority is also on backward compatibility with previous versions,
	compatibility with other packages, and potential future packages.
	The package does not provide a graphical user interface (GUI) per
	se, but the object-oriented API and the fact that reference variables
	are used make it easy for third-party developers to implement a GUI
	for, say, everyday high-throughput normalization. The package is
	available online as open source written in 100% R for maximum accessibility
	on all platforms. Installation is straightforward.},

  note = {(to be submitted)},
  month = {August},
  year = {2007},
  abstract = {Motivation:
	
	Although copy-number aberrations have shown to contribute to the diversity
	of the human DNA and to be the cause of various diseases, many more
	aberrations and their phenotypes are still to be explored. Recent
	developments of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays provide
	researchers with tools for calling genotypes and identifying chromosomal
	aberrations at an order-of-magnitude greater resolution than a few
	years ago. A fundamental problem in array-based copy-number analysis
	is to obtain raw copy-number estimates at a single-locus resolution
	with high accuracy and high precision such that downstream methods
	for identifying consequtive loci with copy-number changes are more
	likely to succeed.
	
	
	Results:
	
	We propose a novel method for estimating raw copy numbers from high-density
	Affymetrix SNP arrays. The core of the method utilizes a robust multichip
	probe-level model (PLM) analogue to that for high-density oligonucleotide
	expression arrays, which has been shown to outperform other methods.
	We improve this by introducing a robust model to control for sequence-specific
	allelic inbalances such as cross-hybridization between allele~A and
	allele~B probes. We focus on total copy-number estimates, which allows
	us to constrain the probe-level model to increase the signal-to-noise
	ratio of raw copy-number estimates further.
	
	Further improvement is obtained by controlling for PCR effects. The
	performance of the method is assessed by quantifying how well raw
	copy numbers alone differentiate between one and two copies on chromosome~X
	at a single-locus resolution (27kb) up to a 200kb resolution. The
	evaluation is done with publicly available HapMap data.
	
	
	Availability:
	
	The proposed method applies to all generations of SNP arrays and is
	available as part of an open-source R package named aroma.affymetrix.
	Because it is a bounded-size memory algorithm, any number of arrays
	can be analyzed.},

	data with proposed robust non-parametric multi-dimensional normalization
	method.},
  journal = BMCBioinfo,
  year = {2006},
  volume = {7},
  pages = {100},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low-level processing and normalization of microarray data
	are most important steps in microarray analysis, which have profound
	impact on downstream analysis. Multiple methods have been suggested
	to date, but it is not clear which is the best. It is therefore important
	to further study the different normalization methods in detail and
	the nature of microarray data in general. RESULTS: A methodological
	study of affine models for gene expression data is carried out. Focus
	is on two-channel comparative studies, but the findings generalize
	also to single- and multi-channel data. The discussion applies to
	spotted as well as in-situ synthesized microarray data. Existing
	normalization methods such as curve-fit ("lowess") normalization,
	parallel and perpendicular translation normalization, and quantile
	normalization, but also dye-swap normalization are revisited in the
	light of the affine model and their strengths and weaknesses are
	investigated in this context. As a direct result from this study,
	we propose a robust non-parametric multi-dimensional affine normalization
	method, which can be applied to any number of microarrays with any
	number of channels either individually or all at once. A high-quality
	cDNA microarray data set with spike-in controls is used to demonstrate
	the power of the affine model and the proposed normalization method.
	CONCLUSION: We find that an affine model can explain non-linear intensity-dependent
	systematic effects in observed log-ratios. Affine normalization removes
	such artifacts for non-differentially expressed genes and assures
	that symmetry between negative and positive log-ratios is obtained,
	which is fundamental when identifying differentially expressed genes.
	In addition, affine normalization makes the empirical distributions
	in different channels more equal, which is the purpose of quantile
	normalization, and may also explain why dye-swap normalization works
	or fails. All methods are made available in the aroma package, which
	is a platform-independent package for R.},

  institution = MatStatLU,
  year = {2004},
  type = {{Preprints in Mathematical Sciences}},
  number = {2004:19},
  abstract = { Background: In this theoretical study we follow up our previous theoretical
	and applied work on affine calibration and normalization methods
	by suggesting a stochastic affine model for two- or multi-channel
	microarrays containing dilution series. With replicated probes (spots)
	at various, not necessarily known, concentration levels it is possible
	to identify the channel biases uniquely. For this to be true it is
	necessary that some genes are differentially expressed, but which
	they are or what their relative gene-expression levels are do not
	have to be known. The method presented may also be applied to so
	called spike-in data. From the maximum likelihood estimator, estimates
	of the relative gene-expression levels for all dilution series follow
	directly. Given the estimated channel biases and scale factors, back
	transformation gives calibrated probe signals that are proportional
	to the amount of fluorophore in each channel. With the assumption
	that most genes are non-differentially expressed, the proposed calibration
	method makes the signals in each channel proportional to the corresponding
	gene-expression levels. Results: The model suggested is a heteroscedastic
	affine model where the standard deviations of the error terms are
	equal for all replicates that belong to the same gene, but may vary
	freely between genes. For a specific probe, the standard deviation
	in one channel is assumed to be proportional to the other channels.
	These constraints were chosen as a compromise between model flexibility
	and feasible parameter estimates. We investigate the properties of
	the parameter estimates from simulated data by comparing bootstrap
	and asymptotic confidence intervals based on normal approximation
	for different setups of number of genes and replicates. We simulate
	two-channel gene-expression data with technical dilution series from
	the suggested model and, in order to investigate the robustness of
	the estimator against model misspecification, a more general model
	for which the standard deviations are not only proportional to the
	gene-expression levels, but also the probe concentrations. We find
	that the standard deviation of the bias-parameter estimates is inversely
	proportional to the square root of the product of the number genes
	and replicates, provided the latter is not too small. For modest
	number of replicates, the standard deviation based on the Fisher
	information is a good approximation to the bootstrap ditto. When
	too few replicates are available, normality can not be assumed and
	the standard errors are under-estimated. For similar reasons, for
	different setups of number of genes and replicates such that the
	total number of probes are the same, we found that it is better to
	use more replicates and fewer genes, if possible. Comparing dilution
	series with uniformly and logarithmic-uniformly distributed concentrations
	better results are obtained using the latter. Availability: All methods
	have been implemented in the cross-platform R package called aroma,
	which is available for free from http://www.braju.com/R/.},

  journal = BMCBioinfo,
  year = {2004},
  volume = {5},
  pages = {177},
  month = {Nov},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-linearities in observed log-ratios of gene expressions,
	also known as intensity dependent log-ratios, can often be accounted
	for by global biases in the two channels being compared. Any step
	in a microarray process may introduce such offsets and in this article
	we study the biases introduced by the microarray scanner and the
	image analysis software. RESULTS: By scanning the same spotted oligonucleotide
	microarray at different photomultiplier tube (PMT) gains, we have
	identified a channel-specific bias present in two-channel microarray
	data. For the scanners analyzed it was in the range of 15-25 (out
	of 65,535). The observed bias was very stable between subsequent
	scans of the same array although the PMT gain was greatly adjusted.
	This indicates that the bias does not originate from a step preceding
	the scanner detector parts. The bias varies slightly between arrays.
	When comparing estimates based on data from the same array, but from
	different scanners, we have found that different scanners introduce
	different amounts of bias. So do various image analysis methods.
	We propose a scanning protocol and a constrained affine model that
	allows us to identify and estimate the bias in each channel. Backward
	transformation removes the bias and brings the channels to the same
	scale. The result is that systematic effects such as intensity dependent
	log-ratios are removed, but also that signal densities become much
	more similar. The average scan, which has a larger dynamical range
	and greater signal-to-noise ratio than individual scans, can then
	be obtained. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that microarray scanners
	may introduce a significant bias in each channel. Such biases have
	to be calibrated for, otherwise systematic effects such as intensity
	dependent log-ratios will be observed. The proposed scanning protocol
	and calibration method is simple to use and is useful for evaluating
	scanner biases or for obtaining calibrated measurements with extended
	dynamical range and better precision. The cross-platform R package
	aroma, which implements all described methods, is available for free

  note = {submitted},
  month = {Dec},
  year = {2009},
  abstract = {Background:
	
	High-throughput genotyping microarrays can be used not only to assess
	changes in total DNA copy number but also changes in allele-specific
	copy numbers (ASCNs). Even after state of the art preprocessing methods,
	ASCN estimates for Affymetrix genotyping arrays still suffer from
	systematic effects that make them difficult to use effectively for
	downstream studies in cancers.
	
	
	Results:
	
	We propose a single-sample method for calibrating ASCN estimates of
	a tumor based on ASCN estimates of a paired normal. The method applies
	to any paired tumor-normal estimates regardless of technology and
	generation. We demonstrate that our method leads to a much clearer
	separation between different ASCN states, including \emph{copy number
	neutral events} that cannot be detected using total copy numbers
	only.
	
	
	Conclusions:
	
	Combined with single-array preprocessing methods, such as CRMA v2,
	we conclude that ASCN estimates with high precisions can be obtained
	from a single pair of tumor-normal hybridizations, and recommend
	using paired tumor-normal DNA microrarray experiments when applicable.

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: The rapid expansion of whole-genome copy number (CN) studies
	brings a demand for increased precision and resolution of CN estimates.
	Recent studies have obtained CN estimates from more than one platform
	for the same set of samples, and it is natural to want to combine
	the different estimates in order to meet this demand. Estimates from
	different platforms show different degrees of attenuation of the
	true CN changes. Similar differences can be observed in CNs from
	the same platform run in different labs, or in the same lab, with
	different analytical methods. This is the reason why it is not straightforward
	to combine CN estimates from different sources (platforms, labs and
	analysis methods). RESULTS: We propose a single-sample multi source
	normalization that brings full-resolution CN estimates to the same
	scale across sources. The normalized CNs are such that for any underlying
	CN level, their mean level is the same regardless of the source,
	which make them better suited for being combined across sources,
	e.g. existing segmentation methods may be used to identify aberrant
	regions. We use microarray-based CN estimates from 'The Cancer Genome
	Atlas' (TCGA) project to illustrate and validate the method. We show
	that the normalized and combined data better separate two CN states
	at a given resolution. We conclude that it is possible to combine
	CNs from multiple sources such that the resolution becomes effectively
	larger, and when multiple platforms are combined, they also enhance
	the genome coverage by complementing each other in different regions.

  abstract = {Summary: We have developed a cross-platform open-source framework
	for analyzing Affymetrix data sets consisting of 1 to 1,000s of arrays.
	By working directly with CDF and CEL files (standard Affymetrix file
	formats) most chip types are automatically supported, e.g. expression,
	SNP, and exon arrays. The package provides methods for low-level
	analysis such as background correction of different kinds, allelic
	cross-talk calibration, quantile and affine normalization, PCR fragment-length
	and GC-content normalization, probe-level summarization such as robust
	log-additive and multiplicative modeling, as well as a set of methods
	for high-level analysis, e.g. chromosomal segmentation and alternative
	splicing. Results can be exported to dynamical HTML reports for easy
	navigation of a large set of arrays both offline and online. All
	algorithms have been optimized to run in bounded memory (as low as
	500MB of RAM) by either redesigning the algorithms or by processing
	data in chunks. Transformed data and parameter estimates are stored
	on file in standard file formats, which in turn minimizes the memory
	overhead, but also makes them immediately accessible to other software.
	Moreover, storing intermediate results in persistent memory makes
	computational expensive analyses more robust against system failures
	and allows for quick resumes. In addition to making common algorithms
	readily available, this package was designed to allow for quicker
	development of novel models and incorporation of existing ones, such
	as Bioconductor methods, and be prepared for future chip types.

	break of both strands, or a chromosome double-strand break (DSB).
	DSBs can arise during normal cellular metabolism, but are also a
	consequence of many forms of cancer therapy. If DSBs are not repaired
	prior to cell division, entire segments of a chromosome can be lost.
	Several pathways ensure that DSBs are repaired, though some pathways
	are prone to causing mutations and/or chromosomal rearrangements,
	each of which can contribute to cancer development. In the first
	part of this study, we describe the roles of individual genetic factors
	in distinct repair pathways of DSBs generated by the I-SceI endonuclease.
	From these studies, we find that some factors can function in multiple
	repair pathways. In the second part of this study, we present a method
	for partially degrading the cohesive DSB overhangs that are generated
	by I-SceI, which we find facilitates repair products that are not
	prone to being re-cut by the endonuclease. As a consequence, we have
	limited the persistence of such breaks, which we find causes a reduction
	in repair pathways that lead to significant genetic loss. As well,
	we use this method to characterize the role of individual genetic
	factors during the repair of non-cohesive DSB ends.</p>},

  abstract = {Comprehensive knowledge of the genomic alterations that underlie cancer
	is a critical foundation for diagnostics, prognostics, and targeted
	therapeutics. Systematic efforts to analyze cancer genomes are underway,
	but the analysis is hampered by the lack of a statistical framework
	to distinguish meaningful events from random background aberrations.
	Here we describe a systematic method, called Genomic Identification
	of Significant Targets in Cancer (GISTIC), designed for analyzing
	chromosomal aberrations in cancer. We use it to study chromosomal
	aberrations in 141 gliomas and compare the results with two prior
	studies. Traditional methods highlight hundreds of altered regions
	with little concordance between studies. The new approach reveals
	a highly concordant picture involving approximately 35 significant
	events, including 16-18 broad events near chromosome-arm size and
	16-21 focal events. Approximately half of these events correspond
	to known cancer-related genes, only some of which have been previously
	tied to glioma. We also show that superimposed broad and focal events
	may have different biological consequences. Specifically, gliomas
	with broad amplification of chromosome 7 have properties different
	from those with overlapping focalEGFR amplification: the broad events
	act in part through effects on MET and its ligand HGF and correlate
	with MET dependence in vitro. Our results support the feasibility
	and utility of systematic characterization of the cancer genome.},

  abstract = {Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosomal regions bearing tumor
	suppressors is a key event in the evolution of epithelial and mesenchymal
	tumors. Identification of these regions usually relies on genotyping
	tumor and counterpart normal DNA and noting regions where heterozygous
	alleles in the normal DNA become homozygous in the tumor. However,
	paired normal samples for tumors and cell lines are often not available.
	With the advent of oligonucleotide arrays that simultaneously assay
	thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, genotyping
	can now be done at high enough resolution to allow identification
	of LOH events by the absence of heterozygous loci, without comparison
	to normal controls. Here we describe a hidden Markov model-based
	method to identify LOH from unpaired tumor samples, taking into account
	SNP intermarker distances, SNP-specific heterozygosity rates, and
	the haplotype structure of the human genome. When we applied the
	method to data genotyped on 100 K arrays, we correctly identified
	99\% of SNP markers as either retention or loss. We also correctly
	identified 81\% of the regions of LOH, including 98\% of regions
	greater than 3 megabases. By integrating copy number analysis into
	the method, we were able to distinguish LOH from allelic imbalance.
	Application of this method to data from a set of prostate samples
	without paired normals identified known regions of prevalent LOH.
	We have developed a method for analyzing high-density oligonucleotide
	SNP array data to accurately identify of regions of LOH and retention
	in tumors without the need for paired normal samples.},

	Results: We analyzed the signal intensities of GeneChip microarrays

	a microscopic binding model. It considers specific and non-specific

  abstract = {The problem of inferring accurate quantitative estimates of transcript
	abundances from gene expression microarray data is addressed. Particular
	attention is paid to correcting chip-to-chip variations arising mainly
	as a result of unwanted nonspecific background hybridization to give
	transcript abundances measured in a common scale. This study verifies
	and generalizes a model of the mutual dependence between nonspecific
	background hybridization and the sensitivity of the specific signal
	using an approach based on the physical chemistry of surface hybridization.
	We have analyzed GeneChip oligonucleotide microarray data taken from
	a set of five benchmark experiments including dilution, Latin Square,
	and "Golden spike" designs. Our analysis concentrates on the important
	effect of changes in the unwanted nonspecific background inherent
	in the technology due to changes in total RNA target concentration
	and/or composition. We find that incremental changes in nonspecific
	background entail opposite sign incremental changes in the effective
	specific binding constant. This effect, which we refer to as the
	"up-down" effect, results from the subtle interplay of competing
	interactions between the probes and specific and nonspecific targets
	at the chip surface and in bulk solution. We propose special rules
	for proper normalization of expression values considering the specifics
	of the up-down effect. Particularly for normalization one has to
	level the expression values of invariant expressed probes. Existing
	heuristic normalization techniques which do not exclude absent probes,
	level intensities instead of expression values, and/or use low variance
	criteria for identifying invariant sets of probes lead to biased
	results. Strengths and pitfalls of selected normalization methods
	are discussed. We also find that the extent of the up-down effect
	is modified if RNA targets are replaced by DNA targets, in that microarray
	sensitivity and specificity are improved via a decrease in nonspecific
	background, which effectively amplifies specific binding. The results
	emphasize the importance of physicochemical approaches for improving
	heuristic normalization algorithms to proceed toward quantitative

	neighboured bases in the middle of their sequence to estimate the
	contribution of matched Watson-Crick (WC) and mismatched self complementary

	a modelindependent estimation of base-specific contributions to the

	~ A for SC pairs and C > G ~ T > A for WC pairs. The bases adjacent
	to the middle base considerably modify the sensitivity as a consequence
	of stacking interactions and sterical effects. Linear combination
	of the triple averaged probe sensitivities provide nearest neighbour
	(NN) sensitivity terms which rank in a similar order as the respective
	NN free energy terms obtained from thermodynamic studies on the stability

	GeneChip probe sensitivities divides the probe intensity into an averaged

	into additive terms because of specific and nonspecific hybridization,

	of labels, and intramolecular folding of target and probe. The observed
	heterogeneity of probe sensitivities is
	
	mainly caused by variations of the probe affinity for target binding
	owing to sequence differences between
	
	the probes. The sensitivity values are therefore analyzed in terms
	of simple molecular characteristics, which
	
	consider the base composition and sequence of the probes. We found

	the ends of the X and Y chromosomes and encompass roughly 2.7 Mb
	(PAR1) and 0.33 Mb (PAR2). As a major asset of recently available
	sequence data, our view of their structural characteristics could
	be refined considerably. While PAR2 resembles the overall sequence
	composition of the X chromosome and exhibits only slightly elevated
	recombination rates, PAR1 is characterized by a significantly higher
	GC content and a completely different repeat structure. In addition,
	it exhibits one of the highest recombination frequencies throughout
	the entire human genome and, probably as a consequence of its structural
	features, displays a significantly faster rate of evolution. It therefore
	represents an exceptional model to explore the correlation between
	meiotic recombination and evolutionary forces such as gene mutation
	and conversion. At least twenty-nine genes lie within the human pseudoautosomal
	regions, and these genes exhibit 'autosomal' rather than sex-specific
	inheritance. All genes within PAR1 escape X inactivation and are
	therefore candidates for the etiology of haploinsufficiency disorders

	pangenomic analyses of DNA copy number alterations (CNAs) using single-nucleotide
	polymorphism arrays have proven useful. METHODS: The pangenomic profiles
	of 22 pairs of primary breast carcinoma (ductal or lobular) and ipsilateral
	breast cancers from the same patients were analyzed. Hierarchical
	clustering was performed using CNAs and DNA breakpoint information.
	A partial identity score developed using DNA breakpoint information
	was used to quantify partial identities between two tumors. The nature
	of ipsilateral breast cancers (true recurrence vs new primary tumor)
	as defined using the clustering methods and the partial identity
	score was compared with that based on clinical characteristics. Metastasis-free
	survival was compared among patients with primary tumors and true
	recurrences as defined using the partial identity score and by clinical
	characteristics. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: All
	methods agreed on the nature of ipsilateral breast cancers for 14
	pairs of samples. For five pairs, the clinical definition disagreed
	with both clustering methods. For three pairs, the two clustering
	methods were discordant and the one using DNA breakpoints agreed
	with the clinical definition. The partial identity score confirmed
	the nature of ipsilateral breast cancers as defined by clustering
	of DNA breakpoints in 21 of 22 pairs. The difference in metastasis-free
	survival of patients with new primary tumors and those with true
	recurrences was not statistically significant when tumors were defined

	oligonucleotide arrays, it is important to remove sources of variation
	between arrays of non-biological origin. Normalization is a process
	for reducing this variation. It is common to see non-linear relations
	between arrays and the standard normalization provided by Affymetrix
	does not perform well in these situations. RESULTS: We present three
	methods of performing normalization at the probe intensity level.
	These methods are called complete data methods because they make
	use of data from all arrays in an experiment to form the normalizing
	relation. These algorithms are compared to two methods that make
	use of a baseline array: a one number scaling based algorithm and
	a method that uses a non-linear normalizing relation by comparing
	the variability and bias of an expression measure. Two publicly available
	datasets are used to carry out the comparisons. The simplest and
	quickest complete data method is found to perform favorably. AVAILABILITY:
	Software implementing all three of the complete data normalization
	methods is available as part of the R package Affy, which is a part

  school = {University of California, Berkeley},

  abstract = {Microarray experiments are currently widely applied in many areas
	of biomedical research. The
	
	Affymetrix GeneChip system is a commercial high-density oligonucleotide
	microarray platform
	
	which measures gene expression using hundreds of thousands of 25-mer
	oligonucleotide probes.
	
	This dissertation addresses how probe intensity data from GeneChips
	are processed to produce
	
	gene expression values and shows how better pre-processing leads to
	gene expression measures,
	
	that after further analysis, yield biologically meaningful conclusions.
	An ideal expression measure
	
	isone which is both precise and accurate.
	
	
	A three-stage procedure for producing an expression measure is proposed.
	For each of the three
	
	stages, background correction, normalization and summarization, numerous
	methods are developed
	
	and assessed using spike-in datasets. Bias and variance criteria are
	used to compare the different
	
	methods of producing expression values. The methods are also judged
	by how well they correctly
	
	identify the differential genes. The background method has a signi?cant
	effect on the bias, which
	
	is reduced, and the variability, which is usually increased. Non-linear
	normalization methods are
	
	found to reduce the non-biological variability between multiple arrays
	without introducing any
	
	significant bias. Robust multi-chip linear models are found to fit
	the data well and provide the 
	
	recommended summarization method.
	
	
	The summarization methodology is extended to produce test statistics
	for determining differential
	
	genes. These test statistics perform favorably at correctly detecting
	differential genes when
	
	compared with alternative methods based on expression values. Finally,
	using case study data, no
	
	statistical benefit is found for using arrays hybridized with mRNA
	from a pool rather than from a
	
	single biological source.},

  school = {Karolinska Institutet},
  year = {2009},
  type = {PhD thesis},
  month = {feb},
  abstract = {A combination of genes, their epigenetic regulation, and the environment
	control the phenotypes of an individual, such as how short or tall
	one grows. Epigenetics refers to chemical modifications of DNA and
	histones that regulate gene activity and genome stability, and can
	take the form of, for example, addition of a methyl group to DNA.
	A rare but illustrative example of growth restriction is Silver-Russel
	syndrome (SRS), which also features a relatively large, triangular
	head and asymmetry between body halves. Molecular studies have demonstrated
	that SRS is an interesting model for how growth is controlled by
	both genetic architecture and epigenetics, and recurring findings
	include DNA hypomethylation at an imprinted region on chromosome
	11 (H19 ICR) in 20-65% of cases, maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome
	7 (matUPD7) in 5-15%, and rare maternal duplications of chromosomes
	7p and 11p. Imprinting is a rare but remarkable epigenetic phenomenon
	that describes parent-of-origin dependent gene activity, such that
	some genes are only expressed if they were inherited from, for example,
	the father. Differential DNA methylation (for example, maternal but
	not paternal methylation) is thought to regulate imprinting. All
	of the above mentioned molecular findings in SRS can cause dysregulation
	of imprinted genes. Interestingly, a large proportion of SRS patients
	remains molecularly unexplained.
	
	In this thesis we applied genome-wide genotyping and targeted epigenetic
	studies of imprinted genes to investigate the genetic nature of SRS
	and to disentangle the epi(genotype) and phenotype correlations in
	SRS and growth restriction. We devised a new approach to confirm
	UPD by the use of genotyping arrays and demonstrated a much increased
	resolution compared to the commonly used microsatellite markers.
	We further demonstrated the power of using genome-wide genotyping
	arrays in rare disorders such as SRS where UPD, copy number variants,
	or shared homozygosity might occur. We identified pathogenic submicroscopic
	events on chromosomes 15, 22, and X in molecularly unexplained SRS
	patients. A simple method for quantification of locus-specific DNA
	methylation is described and its accuracy and quantitative nature
	are demonstrated. In addition, reference distributions of DNA methylation
	at imprinted genes in controls are defined. This method was used
	to evaluate H19 ICR DNA methylation in SRS and isolated growth restriction,
	and 62% of SRS patients were hypomethylated. We further found a dose-response
	relationship between the degree of H19 ICR hypomethylation and phenotype
	severity in SRS and reported for the first time the association of
	specific anomalies of the spine, elbows, hands and feet, and genital
	defects in SRS with severe hypomethylation.
	
	
	In conclusion, we showed the utility of genotyping arrays to identify
	both UPD and submicroscopic genomic aberrations, and demonstrated
	that this genome-wide approach also enables the identification of
	important but unexpected events. Importantly, screens using genotyping
	arrays have the potential to detect the majority of genomic events
	in SRS. Through targeted epigenetic analysis we could conclude that
	H19 ICR methylation is clinically important as demonstrated by a
	strong correlation between the degree of hypomethylation and SRS
	phenotype severity and specifically associated clinical findings.},

	rearrangements led to abnormal transcripts, including two from internal

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are used to discover
	genes underlying complex, heritable disorders for which less powerful
	study designs have failed in the past. The number of GWAS has skyrocketed
	recently with findings reported in top journals and the mainstream
	media. Microarrays are the genotype calling technology of choice
	in GWAS as they permit exploration of more than a million single
	nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) simultaneously. The starting point
	for the statistical analyses used by GWAS to determine association
	between loci and disease is making genotype calls (AA, AB, or BB).
	However, the raw data, microarray probe intensities, are heavily
	processed before arriving at these calls. Various sophisticated statistical
	procedures have been proposed for transforming raw data into genotype
	calls. We find that variability in microarray output quality across
	different SNPs, different arrays, and different sample batches have
	substantial influence on the accuracy of genotype calls made by existing
	algorithms. Failure to account for these sources of variability can
	adversely affect the quality of findings reported by the GWAS. RESULTS:
	We developed a method based on an enhanced version of the multi-level
	model used by CRLMM version 1 (Carvalho et al., 2007). Two key differences
	are that we now account for variability across batches and improve
	the call-specific assessment of each call. The new model permits
	the development of quality metrics for SNPs, samples, and batches
	of samples. Using three independent datasets we demonstrate that
	the CRLMM version 2 outperforms CRLMM version 1 and the algorithm
	provided by Affymetrix, Birdseed. The main advantage of the new approach
	is that it enables the identification of low quality SNPs , samples,
	and batches. AVAILABILITY: Software implementing of the method described
	in this paper is available as free and open source code in the crlmm
	R/BioConductor package. CONTACT: rafa@jhu.edu SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

  abstract = {Alternative pre-messenger RNA splicing influences development, physiology

	of 24,426 alternative splicing events in 48 diverse human samples.
	Over 11,700 genes and 9,500 splicing events were differentially expressed,
	providing a rich resource for studying splicing regulation. An unbiased,
	systematic screen of 21,760 4-mer to 7-mer words for cis-regulatory

	PTB, Fox, Muscleblind, CELF/CUG-BP, TIA-1 and hnRNP F/H, respectively.
	Each cluster showed a distinct pattern of genomic location and tissue
	specificity. For example, UCUCU occurs 110 to 35 nucleotides preceding
	cassette exons upregulated in brain and striated muscle but depleted
	in other tissues. UCUCU and UGCAUG seem to have similar function
	but independent action, occurring 5' and 3', respectively, of 33\%

	in tumorigenesis and tumor progression. Many studies have shown that
	copy-number abnormalities at the DNA level are important in the pathogenesis

	based on expression microarray technology, can reveal the chromosomal
	aberrations in segmental copies at a high resolution. However, due
	to the nature of aCGH, many standard expression data processing tools,
	such as data normalization, often fail to yield satisfactory results.
	RESULTS: We demonstrated a novel aCGH normalization algorithm, which
	provides an accurate aCGH data normalization by utilizing the dependency
	of neighboring probe measurements in aCGH experiments. To facilitate
	the study, we have developed a hidden Markov model (HMM) to simulate
	a series of aCGH experiments with random DNA copy number alterations
	that are used to validate the performance of our normalization. In
	addition, we applied the proposed normalization algorithm to an aCGH
	study of lung cancer cell lines. By using the proposed algorithm,
	data quality and the reliability of experimental results are significantly
	improved, and the distinct patterns of DNA copy number alternations

	to combine the probe-level intensities into one value representing
	the expression level of a gene. However, probe intensity measurements
	are expected to be affected by different levels of non-specific-
	and cross-hybridization to non-specific transcripts. Here, we present
	a new summarization technique, the Distribution Free Weighted method
	(DFW), which uses information about the variability in probe behavior
	to estimate the extent of non-specific and cross-hybridization for
	each probe. The contribution of the probe is weighted accordingly
	during summarization, without making any distributional assumptions
	for the probe-level data. RESULTS: We compare DFW with several popular
	summarization methods on spike-in datasets, via both our own calculations
	and the 'Affycomp II' competition. The results show that DFW outperforms
	other methods when sensitivity and specificity are considered simultaneously.
	With the Affycomp spike-in datasets, the area under the receiver
	operating characteristic curve for DFW is nearly 1.0 (a perfect value),
	indicating that DFW can identify all differentially expressed genes
	with a few false positives. The approach used is also computationally
	faster than most other methods in current use. AVAILABILITY: The

  abstract = {From microarray measurement, we seek differentiation of mRNA expressions
	among different biological samples. However, each array has a 'block
	effect' due to uncontrolled variation. The statistical treatment
	of reducing the block effect is usually referred to as normalization.
	Our perspective is to find a transformation that matches the distributions
	of hybridization levels of those probes corresponding to undifferentiated
	genes between arrays. We address two important issues. First, array-specific
	spatial patterns exist due to uneven hybridization and measurement
	process. Second, in some cases a substantially large portion of genes
	are differentially expressed between a target and a reference array.
	For the purpose of normalization we need to identify a subset that
	exclude those probes corresponding to differentially expressed genes
	and abnormal probes due to experimental variation. Least trimmed
	squares (LTS) is a natural choice to achieve this goal. Substantial
	differentiation is protected in LTS by setting an appropriate trimming
	fraction. To take into account any spatial pattern of hybridization,
	we divide each array into sub-arrays and normalize probe intensities
	within each sub-array. We illustrate the problem and solution through
	an Affymetrix spike-in dataset with defined perturbation and a dataset

	mutations, copy-number alterations and structural rearrangements.
	A powerful way to discover cancer-causing genes is to identify genomic
	regions that show recurrent copy-number alterations (gains and losses)
	in tumor genomes. Recent advances in sequencing technologies suggest
	that massively parallel sequencing may provide a feasible alternative
	to DNA microarrays for detecting copy-number alterations. Here we
	present: (i) a statistical analysis of the power to detect copy-number
	alterations of a given size; (ii) SegSeq, an algorithm to segment
	equal copy numbers from massively parallel sequence data; and (iii)
	analysis of experimental data from three matched pairs of tumor and
	normal cell lines. We show that a collection of approximately 14
	million aligned sequence reads from human cell lines has comparable
	power to detect events as the current generation of DNA microarrays
	and has over twofold better precision for localizing breakpoints
	(typically, to within approximately 1 kilobase).},

	of immunity and, in turn, susceptibility to the common cold. This
	article examines whether sleep duration and efficiency in the weeks
	preceding viral exposure are associated with cold susceptibility.
	METHODS: A total of 153 healthy men and women (age range, 21-55 years)
	volunteered to participate in the study. For 14 consecutive days,
	they reported their sleep duration and sleep efficiency (percentage
	of time in bed actually asleep) for the previous night and whether
	they felt rested. Average scores for each sleep variable were calculated
	over the 14-day baseline. Subsequently, participants were quarantined,
	administered nasal drops containing a rhinovirus, and monitored for
	the development of a clinical cold (infection in the presence of
	objective signs of illness) on the day before and for 5 days after
	exposure. RESULTS: There was a graded association with average sleep
	duration: participants with less than 7 hours of sleep were 2.94
	times (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-7.30) more likely to develop
	a cold than those with 8 hours or more of sleep. The association
	with sleep efficiency was also graded: participants with less than
	92\% efficiency were 5.50 times (95\% CI, 2.08-14.48) more likely
	to develop a cold than those with 98\% or more efficiency. These
	relationships could not be explained by differences in prechallenge
	virus-specific antibody titers, demographics, season of the year,
	body mass, socioeconomic status, psychological variables, or health
	practices. The percentage of days feeling rested was not associated
	with colds. CONCLUSION: Poorer sleep efficiency and shorter sleep
	duration in the weeks preceding exposure to a rhinovirus were associated
	with lower resistance to illness.},

	the apoptotic process among sequences that are replicated very early
	(approximately in the first hour of S phase) in both fibroblasts

	for detecting regions of copy number variation from BeadArray SNP
	genotyping data using an Objective Bayes Hidden-Markov Model (OB-HMM).
	Objective Bayes measures are used to set certain hyperparameters
	in the priors using a novel re-sampling framework to calibrate the
	model to a fixed Type I (false positive) error rate. Other parameters
	are set via maximum marginal likelihood to prior training data of

	of state classifications and significantly improves the accuracy
	of segmental aneuploidy identification and mapping, relative to existing
	analytical tools (Beadstudio, Illumina), as demonstrated by validation
	of breakpoint boundaries. QuantiSNP identified both novel and validated
	CNVs. QuantiSNP was developed using BeadArray SNP data but it can
	be adapted to other platforms and we believe that the OB-HMM framework

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The accurate and high resolution mapping of
	DNA copy number aberrations has become an important tool by which
	to gain insight into the mechanisms of tumourigenesis. There are
	various commercially available platforms for such studies, but there
	remains no general consensus as to the optimal platform. There have
	been several previous platform comparison studies, but they have
	either described older technologies, used less-complex samples, or
	have not addressed the issue of the inherent biases in such comparisons.
	Here we describe a systematic comparison of data from four leading
	microarray technologies (the Affymetrix Genome-wide SNP 5.0 array,
	Agilent High-Density CGH Human 244A array, Illumina HumanCNV370-Duo
	DNA Analysis BeadChip, and the Nimblegen 385K oligonucleotide array).
	We compare samples derived from primary breast tumours and their
	corresponding matched normals, well-established cancer cell lines,
	and normal HapMap individuals. By careful consideration and avoidance
	of potential sources of bias, we aim to provide a fair assessment
	of platform performance. RESULTS: By performing a theoretical assessment
	of the reproducibility, noise, and sensitivity of each platform,
	notable differences were revealed. Nimblegen exhibited between-replicate
	array variances an order of magnitude greater than the other three
	platforms, with Agilent slightly outperforming the others, and a
	comparison of self-self hybridizations revealed similar patterns.
	An assessment of the single probe power revealed that Agilent exhibits
	the highest sensitivity. Additionally, we performed an in-depth visual
	assessment of the ability of each platform to detect aberrations
	of varying sizes. As expected, all platforms were able to identify
	large aberrations in a robust manner. However, some focal amplifications
	and deletions were only detected in a subset of the platforms. CONCLUSIONS:
	Although there are substantial differences in the design, density,
	and number of replicate probes, the comparison indicates a generally
	high level of concordance between platforms, despite differences
	in the reproducibility, noise, and sensitivity. In general, Agilent
	tended to be the best aCGH platform and Affymetrix, the superior
	SNP-CGH platform, but for specific decisions the results described
	herein provide a guide for platform selection and study design, and
	the dataset a resource for more tailored comparisons.},

	large number of SNPs to be genotyped in multiple individuals who
	exhibit phenotypic variation in a trait of interest. Microarray technology
	can enable rapid genotyping of variation specific to study samples.
	To facilitate their use, we have developed an automated statistical

	this method to Affymetrix Variation Detection Arrays (VDAs). ABACUS
	provides a quality score to individual genotypes, allowing investigators

	We have applied ABACUS to an experiment encompassing 32 autosomal

	At sufficiently high-quality scores, we are able to read approximately
	80\% of all sites. To assess the accuracy of SNP detection, 108 of
	108 SNPs have been experimentally confirmed; an additional 371 SNPs
	have been confirmed electronically. To access the accuracy of diploid
	genotypes at segregating autosomal sites, we confirmed 1515 of 1515

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: A high density of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
	coverage on the genome is desirable and often an essential requirement
	for population genetics studies. Region-specific or chromosome-specific
	linkage studies also benefit from the availability of as many high
	quality SNPs as possible. The availability of millions of SNPs from
	both Perlegen and the public domain and the development of an efficient
	microarray-based assay for genotyping SNPs has brought up some interesting
	analytical challenges. Effective methods for the selection of optimal
	subsets of SNPs spanning the genome and methods for accurately calling
	genotypes from probe hybridization patterns have enabled the development
	of a new microarray-based system for robustly genotyping over 100,000
	SNPs per sample. RESULTS: We introduce a new dynamic model-based
	algorithm (DM) for screening over 3 million SNPs and genotyping over
	100,000 SNPs. The model is based on four possible underlying states:
	Null, A, AB and B for each probe quartet. We calculate a probe-level
	log likelihood for each model and then select between the four competing
	models with an SNP-level statistical aggregation across multiple
	probe quartets to provide a high-quality genotype call along with
	a quality measure of the call. We assess performance with HapMap
	reference genotypes, informative Mendelian inheritance relationship
	in families, and consistency between DM and another genotype classification
	method. At a call rate of 95.91\% the concordance with reference
	genotypes from the HapMap Project is 99.81\% based on over 1.5 million
	genotypes, the Mendelian error rate is 0.018\% based on 10 trios,
	and the consistency between DM and MPAM is 99.90\% at a comparable
	rate of 97.18\%. We also develop methods for SNP selection and optimal
	probe selection. AVAILABILITY: The DM algorithm is available in Affymetrix's
	Genotyping Tools software package and in Affymetrix's GDAS software

	Systems employs chemistry in microarrays, fluorescence reading, and
	bioinformatics to gain insight into the metabolic regulation of the
	glycolytic pathway. In this research program silicon-based labs-on-chips
	are being developed; each vial on the microarray will be equipped
	with various sensors and actuators. With this kind of microarray
	technology enormous amounts of data will be generated. Development
	of dedicated data analysis and data interpretation systems is necessary
	to extract useful information from the experimental data and to combine
	that with present data and knowledge. Currently, the enzyme-catalyzed
	reactions of this pathway can be monitored in microarrays via the
	production or consumption of NADH. The activity levels of the enzymes
	involved in the reactions can be derived from the production or consumption
	rates of this fluorescent molecule. The biochemical reactions are
	monitored with a modified conventional microscope system equipped
	with a scientific grade CCD camera. With low power optics fluorescent
	signals from an entire microarray can be acquired in a single image.
	This allows for a parallel readout of the microarray. Wide field-of-view
	imaging, however, is at the expense of absolute sensitivity. High
	power optics guarantees a high collection efficiency, but implies
	a sequential readout of the microarray. With this kind of microarray
	reading system, there are two possible limiting factors in the instrument
	that determine the lowest detectable concentration of fluorescent
	particles. These limiting factors are stray light and readout noise.
	If readout noise limits the detection, then the detection limit can
	be lowered by imaging the fluorescent signal onto as few pixels as
	possible. This can be accomplished by choosing a CCD camera with
	large pixels, where each pixel has a low readout noise level. A second
	modification is to demagnify the image by placing a second objective
	back-to-back to the primary objective lens in the emission path.
	If stray light limits the detection, then a better detector will
	not result in a lower detection limit, since it will not improve
	the signal-to-noise ratio of the measurements. Applying the same
	modifications to the microscope system will result in a faster scanning
	rate of the microarray. We have demonstrated the functionality of
	our conventional microscope-based microarray reader for this research
	program by monitoring an NADH producing and consuming reaction at
	different enzyme activity levels in the microarrays. Monitoring Dynamic
	Liquid Behavior in Micromachined Vials. Evaporation is a key problem
	in the development of micrarray technology, especially in the case
	of open reactors. Within the framework of this research program methods
	to avoid fast evaporation of solvents have been developed. Still,
	the process of evaporation at a nanoliter scale is an interesting
	phenomenon to study, and a requirement for calibration of a dedicated
	impedance based volume sensor. Quantitative measurements of the dynamic
	process of evaporation in the vials of our microarrays requires sufficient
	spatial (lateral and axial) as well as temporal sampling. Interference-contrast
	microscopy is a technique that satisfies both sampling requirements.
	With this technique an interference pattern is generated at the air-liquid
	interface of the evaporating liquid sample. This interference pattern
	shows fringes of equal height. With a temporal phase unwrapping algorithm
	these fringe patterns are analyzed in time point-by-point. With this
	algorithm the height profile of the air-liquid interface can be reconstructed
	without using any spatial correlating function. The instant that
	the air-liquid interface is perfectly flat is used to calibrate all
	one-dimensional height maps. Applying this technique to reconstruct
	the shape of the interface that generated this fringe pattern requires
	only spatial sampling at half the Nyquist frequency, whereas a spatial
	phase unwrapping technique requires spatial sampling at the Nyquist
	frequency. A straightforward measurement from these results is the
	remaining liquid volume as a function of time, and from that the
	evaporation rate. A counterintuitive result is that the evaporation
	rate is proportional to the perimeter of the vial, and not to the
	area of the air-liquid interface. This can be explained by the fact
	that the liquid is pinned to the edge of the vial and that diffusion
	is the rate limiting step of the evaporation process. Furthermore,
	when there are objects present on the bottom of the vials, these
	objects introduce phase differences in the interference pattern,
	which are observed as segmented fringes. Spatial phase unwrapping
	algorithms will fail analyzing patterns with segmented fringes. A
	temporal phase unwrapping algorithm, however, is insensitive for
	these kind of segmented fringes. With this technique it is possible
	to measure the height of objects on a nanometer scale. },

  abstract = {We have addressed two important issues of nonlinear cross-talk and
	baseline adjustment in DNA data processing. An important aspect in
	the processing of the four-dye fluorescence-based data is the cross-talk
	filtering. Typically, a matrix M, which is a function of the fluorophores
	and the fluorescence detection system, is used in the multicomponent
	analysis. In this deconvolution process the matrix is applied directly
	to the raw signal, on a linear cross-talk assumption. This necessitates
	the signal to be aligned to the baseline before the filter is applied.
	The various techniques used for aligning the raw data have the negative
	effect of adding distortion to the signal. An algorithm for cross-talk
	removal is presented in this paper. The algorithm uses the intensity
	difference of the signal rather than the actual value itself, thus
	making the cross-talk removal possible before the base line adjustment.
	In addition, a supplementary filtering step is proposed in order
	to account for the nonlinear nature of the cross-talk. This second
	step is based on a matrix T that accounts for the correlation of
	each of the signals with the other three. The overall result is a
	more precise presentation of the DNA data and less information loss
	through filtering.},

	been noted, including the inability to relate ratios to absolute
	expression levels or to compare experimental conditions not measured

	overcoming these obstacles. First, instead of cohybridizing labeled
	experimental and control samples, we hybridize each sample against
	labeled oligos complementary to every microarray feature. Ratios
	between sample intensities and intensities of the oligo reference
	measure sample RNA levels on a scale that relates to their absolute
	abundance, instead of to the variable and unknown abundances of a
	cDNA reference. We demonstrate that results from this type of hybridization
	are accurate and retain absolute abundance information far better
	than conventional microarray ratios. Next, to ensure the accurate
	measurement of sample and oligo reference intensities, which may
	differ by several orders of magnitude, we use a linear regression
	algorithm, implemented in a freely available PERL script, to combine
	the linear ranges of multiple scans taken at different scanner sensitivity
	settings onto an extended linear scale. We discuss future applications

  abstract = {Microarrays are part of a new class of biotechnologies which allow
	the monitoring of expression levels for thousands of genes simultaneously.
	This paper describes statistical methods for the identification of
	differentially expressed genes in replicated cDNA microarray experiments.
	Although it is not the main focus of the paper, we stress the importance
	of issues such as image processing and normalization. Image processing
	is required to extract measures of transcript abundance for each
	gene spotted on the array from the laser scan images. Normalization
	is needed to identify and remove systematic sources of variation,
	such as differing dye labeling efficiencies and scanning properties.
	There can be many systematic sources of variation and their effects
	can be large relative to the effects of interest. After a brief presentation
	of our image processing method, we describe a within-slide normalization
	approach which handles spatial and intensity dependent effects on
	the measured expression levels. Given suitably normalized data, our
	proposed method for the identification of single differentially expressed
	genes is to consider a univariate testing problem for each gene and
	then correct for multiple testing using adjusted p-values. No specific
	parametric form is assumed for the distribution of the expression
	levels and a permutation procedure is used to estimate the joint
	null distribution of the test statistics for each gene. Several data
	displays are suggested for the visual identification of genes with
	altered expression and of important features of these genes. The
	above methods are applied to microarray data from a study of gene
	expression in two mouse models with very low HDL cholesterol levels.
	The genes identified using data from replicated slides are compared
	to those obtained by applying recently published single-slide methods.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Several cancer prevention programmes have previously been
	executed using treatment of antioxidant compounds. The antioxidant
	N-acetyl L-cysteine (NAC), a membrane-permeable aminothiol, is a
	sulfhydryl reductant reducing oxidised glutathione, as well as being
	a precursor of intracellular cysteine and glutathione. A previous
	report based on the cellular response to NAC treatment showed that
	NAC induced a 10-fold more rapid differentiation in normal primary
	keratinocytes as well as a reversion of a colon carcinoma cell line
	from neoplastic proliferation to apical-basolateral differentiation.
	In order to investigate molecular events underlying the changes in
	proliferation and differentiation induced by NAC treatment, we performed
	global gene expression analysis of normal human epidermal keratinocytes
	in a time series. METHODS: Treated samples were compared to untreated
	samples through a reference design using a spotted cDNA array comprising
	approximately 30,000 features. B statistics was used to identify
	differentially expressed genes, and RT-PCR of a selected set of genes
	was performed to verify differential expression. RESULTS: The number
	of differentially expressed genes increased over time, starting with
	0 at 30 min, 73 at 3 h and increasing to 952 genes at 48 h. Results
	of the expression analysis showed arrest of the cell cycle and an
	upregulation of cytoskeletal reorganisation, implicating increased
	differentiation. A comparison to gene ontology groups indicated downregulation
	of a large number of genes involved in cell proliferation and regulation
	of the cell cycle. CONCLUSIONS: A significant fraction of the differentially
	expressed genes could be classified according to their role in the
	differentiation process, demonstrating that NAC regulates the conversion
	from proliferation to differentiation at a transcriptional level.},

	slow component of the cardiac delayed rectifier K(+) current. Since
	duplication of the KCNQ1 gene encoding the alpha-subunit of the same
	channel was reported recently in another SRS patient, we screened
	both genes for mutations in a cohort of SRS patients without detecting
	pathologic variants. We presume that the duplication of the two functionally

	finding. However, the lack of DS typical clinical features in our
	case allows us to further narrow down the DSCR in 21q22. We conclude
	that DSCR1/RCAN is not sufficient for generating phenotypic features
	associated with DS but our observation does not contradict a possible

  abstract = {The quantitative comparison of two or more microarrays can reveal,
	for example, the distinct patterns of gene expression that define
	different cellular phenotypes or the genes that are induced in the
	cellular response to certain stimulations. Normalization of the measured
	intensities is a prerequisite of such comparisons. However, a fundamental
	problem in cDNA microarray analysis is the lack of a common standard
	to compare the expression levels of different samples. Several normalization
	protocols have been proposed to overcome the variabilities inherent
	in this technology. We have developed a normalization procedure based
	on within-array replications via a semilinear in-slide model, which
	adjusts objectively experimental variations without making critical
	biological assumptions. The significant analysis of gene expressions
	is based on a weighted t statistic, which accounts for the heteroscedasticity
	of the observed log ratios of expressions, and a balanced sign permutation
	test. We illustrated the use of the techniques in a comparison of
	the expression profiles of neuroblastoma cells that were stimulated
	with a growth factor, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF).
	The analysis of expression changes at mRNA levels showed that approximately
	99 genes were up-regulated and 24 were reduced significantly (P <0.001)
	in MIF-stimulated neuroblastoma cells. The regulated genes included
	several oncogenes, growth-related genes, tumor metastatic genes,
	and immuno-related genes. The findings provide clues as to the molecular
	mechanisms of MIF-mediated tumor progression and supply therapeutic

	an estimated 50-100 million cases of dengue fever and 250,000-500,000
	cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome each year,
	a clear understanding of dengue pathogenesis remains elusive. Because
	of the lack of a disease model in animals and the complex immune
	interaction in dengue infection, the study of host response and immunopathogenesis
	is difficult. The development of genomics technology, microarray
	and high throughput quantitative PCR have allowed researchers to
	study gene expression changes on a much broader scale. We therefore
	used this approach to investigate the host response in dengue virus-infected
	cell lines and in patients developing dengue fever. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL
	FINDINGS: Using microarray and high throughput quantitative PCR method
	to monitor the host response to dengue viral replication in cell
	line infection models and in dengue patient blood samples, we identified
	differentially expressed genes along three major pathways; NF-kappaB
	initiated immune responses, type I interferon (IFN) and the ubiquitin
	proteasome pathway. Among the most highly upregulated genes were
	the chemokines IP-10 and I-TAC, both ligands of the CXCR3 receptor.
	Increased expression of IP-10 and I-TAC in the peripheral blood of
	ten patients at the early onset of fever was confirmed by ELISA.
	A highly upregulated gene in the IFN pathway, viperin, was overexpressed
	in A549 cells resulting in a significant reduction in viral replication.
	The upregulation of genes in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway prompted
	the testing of proteasome inhibitors MG-132 and ALLN, both of which
	reduced viral replication. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Unbiased gene
	expression analysis has identified new host genes associated with
	dengue infection, which we have validated in functional studies.
	We showed that some parts of the host response can be used as potential
	biomarkers for the disease while others can be used to control dengue
	viral replication, thus representing viable targets for drug therapy.},

  pages = {497},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microarray comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is
	currently one of the most powerful techniques to measure DNA copy
	number in large genomes. In humans, microarray CGH is widely used
	to assess copy number variants in healthy individuals and copy number
	aberrations associated with various diseases, syndromes and disease
	susceptibility. In model organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans
	(C. elegans) the technique has been applied to detect mutations,
	primarily deletions, in strains of interest. Although various constraints
	on oligonucleotide properties have been suggested to minimize non-specific
	hybridization and improve the data quality, there have been few experimental
	validations for CGH experiments. For genomic regions where strict
	design filters would limit the coverage it would also be useful to
	quantify the expected loss in data quality associated with relaxed
	design criteria. RESULTS: We have quantified the effects of filtering
	various oligonucleotide properties by measuring the resolving power
	for detecting deletions in the human and C. elegans genomes using
	NimbleGen microarrays. Approximately twice as many oligonucleotides
	are typically required to be affected by a deletion in human DNA
	samples in order to achieve the same statistical confidence as one
	would observe for a deletion in C. elegans. Surprisingly, the ability
	to detect deletions strongly depends on the oligonucleotide 15-mer
	count, which is defined as the sum of the genomic frequency of all
	the constituent 15-mers within the oligonucleotide. A similarity
	level above 80\% to non-target sequences over the length of the probe
	produces significant cross-hybridization. We recommend the use of
	a fairly large melting temperature window of up to 10 degrees C,
	the elimination of repeat sequences, the elimination of homopolymers
	longer than 5 nucleotides, and a threshold of -1 kcal/mol on the
	oligonucleotide self-folding energy. We observed very little difference
	in data quality when varying the oligonucleotide length between 50
	and 70, and even when using an isothermal design strategy. CONCLUSION:
	We have determined experimentally the effects of varying several
	key oligonucleotide microarray design criteria for detection of deletions
	in C. elegans and humans with NimbleGen's CGH technology. Our oligonucleotide
	design recommendations should be applicable for CGH analysis in most

	In order to deliver on this promise the correct defined conditions

	in physiologically approximate levels of oxygen. These physiological
	values fall in the range of 2 to 5\% O2. Benefits include reduced
	spontaneous differentiation, enhanced chromosomal stability and increased
	clonality. AIMS: The aim of our study was to examine the transcriptional
	consequences of culturing hESCs in physiological normoxia (2\% O2)
	using microarray technology. METHODS: Three karyoptically normal
	hESC lines (H1, H9 and RH1) were examined. At the initiation of this
	experiment, established hESC lines were redesignated as passage (p)
	0 in 21\% O2, then bifurcated into 21\% O2 and 2\% O2, and maintained
	for a further ten passages at which time samples were again collected.
	RNA was extracted from all sample points and subjected to microarray
	analysis using the Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 platform. Bioinformatic
	analysis was performed using dChip and GoStat. RESULTS: We performed
	grouped analyses of gene expression of early (p0) versus late (p10)
	air-cultured cells. This revealed relative stability with six (air
	p0 baseline vs p10 experimental) and one (air p10 baseline vs p0
	experimental) gene(s) displaying both greater than twofold and statistically
	significant upregulation. Conversely, we identified 302 gene upregulations

	O2 (p10). These significantly upregulated changes clustered into
	82 over-represented and 9 under-represented ontology terms. These
	terms were indicative of signaling pathways, developmental potential
	and metabolism. Hierarchical clustering indicated a trend for 2\%
	O2 cultured cells to cluster collectively with reduced heterogeneity
	when compared with 21\% O2 cultured cells. CONCLUSIONS: The gene
	changes associated with 2\% O2 culture may be predictive of novel
	cellular requirements for stable self-renewal, maintenance of pluripotency,

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Genomic DNA copy number aberrations are frequent
	in solid tumors, although the underlying causes of chromosomal instability
	in tumors remain obscure. Genes likely to have genomic instability
	phenotypes when mutated (e.g. those involved in mitosis, replication,
	repair, and telomeres) are rarely mutated in chromosomally unstable
	sporadic tumors, even though such mutations are associated with some
	heritable cancer prone syndromes. METHODS: We applied array comparative
	genomic hybridization (CGH) to the analysis of breast tumors. The
	variation in the levels of genomic instability amongst tumors prompted
	us to investigate whether alterations in processes/genes involved
	in maintenance and/or manipulation of the genome were associated
	with particular types of genomic instability. RESULTS: We discriminated
	three breast tumor subtypes based on genomic DNA copy number alterations.
	The subtypes varied with respect to level of genomic instability.
	We find that shorter telomeres and altered telomere related gene
	expression are associated with amplification, implicating telomere
	attrition as a promoter of this type of aberration in breast cancer.
	On the other hand, the numbers of chromosomal alterations, particularly
	low level changes, are associated with altered expression of genes
	in other functional classes (mitosis, cell cycle, DNA replication
	and repair). Further, although loss of function instability phenotypes
	have been demonstrated for many of the genes in model systems, we
	observed enhanced expression of most genes in tumors, indicating
	that over expression, rather than deficiency underlies instability.
	CONCLUSIONS: Many of the genes associated with higher frequency of
	copy number aberrations are direct targets of E2F, supporting the
	hypothesis that deregulation of the Rb pathway is a major contributor
	to chromosomal instability in breast tumors. These observations are
	consistent with failure to find mutations in sporadic tumors in genes
	that have roles in maintenance or manipulation of the genome.},

	In one large, tightly controlled study involving 123 microarray hybridizations

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genomic hybridization platforms, including BAC-CGH and
	genotyping arrays, have been used to estimate chromosome copy number
	(CN) in tumor samples by detecting the relative strength of genomic
	signal. The methods rely on the assumption that the predominant chromosomal
	background of the samples is diploid, an assumption that is frequently
	incorrect for tumor samples. In addition to generally greater resolution,
	an advantage of genotyping arrays over CGH arrays is the ability
	to detect signals from individual alleles, allowing estimation of
	loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) and allelic ratios to enhance the interpretation
	of copy number alterations. Copy number events associated with LOH
	potentially have the same genetic consequences as deletions. RESULTS:
	We have utilized allelic ratios to detect patterns that are indicative
	of higher ploidy levels. An integrated analysis using allelic ratios,
	total signal and LOH indicates that many or most of the chromosomes
	from 24 glioblastoma tumors are in fact aneuploid. Some putative
	whole-chromosome losses actually represent trisomy, and many apparent
	sub-chromosomal losses are in fact relative losses against a triploid
	or tetraploid background. CONCLUSION: These results suggest a re-interpretation
	of previous findings based only on total signal ratios. One interesting
	observation is that many single or multiple-copy deletions occur
	at common putative tumor suppressor sites subsequent to chromosomal
	duplication; these losses do not necessarily result in LOH, but nonetheless
	occur in conspicuous patterns. The 500 K Mapping array was also capable
	of detecting many sub-mega base losses and gains that were overlooked
	by CGH-BAC arrays, and was superior to CGH-BAC arrays in resolving

  abstract = {For various reasons, it is important, if not essential, to integrate
	the computations and code used in data analyses, methodological descriptions,
	simulations, etc. with the documents that describe and rely on them.
	This integration allows readers to both verify and adapt the statements
	in the documents. Authors can easily reproduce them in the future,
	and they can present the document's contents in a different medium,
	e.g. with interactive controls. This paper describes a software framework
	for authoring and distributing these integrated, dynamic documents
	that contain text, code, data, and any auxiliary content needed to
	recreate the computations. The documents are dynamic in that the
	contents, including figures, tables, etc., can be recalculated each
	time a view of the document is generated. Our model treats a dynamic
	document as a master or ``source'' document from which one can generate
	different views in the form of traditional, derived documents for
	different audiences.
	
	
	 We introduce the concept of a compendium as both a container for
	the different elements that make up the document and its computations
	(i.e. text, code, data, ...), and as a means for distributing, managing
	and updating the collection.
	
	
	 The step from disseminating analyses via a compendium to reproducible
	research is a small one. By reproducible research, we mean research
	papers with accompanying software tools that allow the reader to
	directly reproduce the results and employ the methods that are presented
	in the research paper. Some of the issues involved in paradigms for
	the production, distribution and use of such reproducible research
	are discussed.},

	leading-edge technology for large-scale analysis of gene and protein
	content and activity. Contact-printed microarrays has emerged as
	a relatively simple and cost effective method of choice but its reliability
	is especially susceptible to quality of pixel information obtained
	from digital scans of spotted features in the microarray image. RESULTS:
	We address the statistical computation requirements for optimizing
	data acquisition and processing of digital scans. We consider the
	use of median filters to reduce noise levels in images and top-hat
	filters to correct for trends in background values. We also consider,
	as alternative estimators of spot intensity, discs of fixed radius,
	proportions of histograms and k-means clustering, either with or
	without a square-root intensity transformation and background subtraction.
	We identify, using combinatoric procedures, optimal filter and estimator
	parameters, in achieving consistency among the replicates of a gene
	on each microarray. Our results, using test data from microarrays
	of HCMV, indicate that a highly effective approach for improving
	reliability and quality of microarray data is to apply a 21 by 21
	top-hat filter, then estimate spot intensity as the mean of the largest
	20\% of pixel values in the target region, after a square-root transformation,
	and corrected for background, by subtracting the mean of the smallest
	70\% of pixel values. AVAILABILITY: Fortran90 subroutines implementing

	acquisitions of microarray images.},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2009},
  volume = {10},
  pages = {98},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are many sources of variation in dual labelled microarray
	experiments, including data acquisition and image processing. The
	final interpretation of experiments strongly relies on the accuracy
	of the measurement of the signal intensity. For low intensity spots
	in particular, accurately estimating gene expression variations remains
	a challenge as signal measurement is, in this case, highly subject
	to fluctuations. RESULTS: To evaluate the fluctuations in the fluorescence
	intensities of spots, we used series of successive scans, at the
	same settings, of whole genome arrays. We measured the decrease in
	fluorescence and we evaluated the influence of different parameters
	(PMT gain, resolution and chemistry of the slide) on the signal variability,
	at the level of the array as a whole and by intensity interval. Moreover,
	we assessed the effect of averaging scans on the fluctuations. We
	found that the extent of photo-bleaching was low and we established
	that 1) the fluorescence fluctuation is linked to the resolution
	e.g. it depends on the number of pixels in the spot 2) the fluorescence
	fluctuation increases as the scanner voltage increases and, moreover,
	is higher for the red as opposed to the green fluorescence which
	can introduce bias in the analysis 3) the signal variability is linked
	to the intensity level, it is higher for low intensities 4) the heterogeneity
	of the spots and the variability of the signal and the intensity
	ratios decrease when two or three scans are averaged. CONCLUSION:
	Protocols consisting of two scans, one at low and one at high PMT
	gains, or multiple scans (ten scans) can introduce bias or be difficult
	to implement. We found that averaging two, or at most three, acquisitions
	of microarrays scanned at moderate photomultiplier settings (PMT
	gain) is sufficient to significantly improve the accuracy (quality)
	of the data and particularly those for spots having low intensities
	and we propose this as a general approach. For averaging and precise
	image alignment at sub-pixel levels we have made a program freely
	available on our web-site http://bioinfome.cgm.cnrs-gif.fr to facilitate
	implementation of this approach.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: This study was designed to elucidate the role of amplification
	at 8q24 in the pathophysiology of ovarian and breast cancer because
	increased copy number at this locus is one of the most frequent genomic
	abnormalities in these cancers. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To accomplish
	this, we assessed the association of amplification at 8q24 with outcome
	in ovarian cancers using fluorescence in situ hybridization to tissue
	microarrays and measured responses of ovarian and breast cancer cell
	lines to specific small interfering RNAs against the oncogene MYC
	and a putative noncoding RNA, PVT1, both of which map to 8q24. RESULTS:
	Amplification of 8q24 was associated with significantly reduced survival
	duration. In addition, small interfering RNA-mediated reduction in
	either PVT1 or MYC expression inhibited proliferation in breast and
	ovarian cancer cell lines in which they were both amplified and overexpressed
	but not in lines in which they were not amplified/overexpressed.
	Inhibition of PVT1 expression also induced a strong apoptotic response
	in cell lines in which it was overexpressed but not in lines in which
	it was not amplified/overexpressed. Inhibition of MYC, on the other
	hand, did not induce an apoptotic response in cell lines in which
	MYC was amplified and overexpressed. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest
	that MYC and PVT1 contribute independently to ovarian and breast
	pathogenesis when overexpressed because of genomic abnormalities.
	They also suggest that PVT1-mediated inhibition of apoptosis may
	explain why amplification of 8q24 is associated with reduced survival
	duration in patients treated with agents that act through apoptotic
	mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Complementary DNA (cDNA) microarray imaging technology is a revolutionary
	innovation for genomic research that allows monitoring of expression
	levels for thousands of genes simultaneously. The raw data of cDNA
	microarray is shown as red and green channel images that are quantitatively
	analysed to obtain the gene expression measurements. It can affect
	the subsequent analysis such as identification of genes differentially
	expressed. cDNA microarray image analysis includes three tasks: image
	filtering, segmentation and information extraction. This paper presents
	a novel-filtering framework that is capable of processing cDNA microarray
	images. The experimental result is compared with those obtained from
	the widely used Gaussian de-noising techniques, wavelet de-noising
	techniques and morphological filtering technique. Simulation in this
	paper indicates that the proposed edge-enhancing diffusion filter
	and morphological operators are computationally attractive, yield
	excellent performance and are able to preserve structural information
	while efficiently suppressing noise in cDNA microarray data. The
	result of experiment shows that it is robust and precise.},

	Several miRNAs in this study expressed highly at different time points,

	trials, for example, and from crossover designs. They also arise
	in experiments to verify the equivalence of quantitative assays.
	This latter use (which is the main focus of this paper) raises difficulties
	not always seen in other matched pairs applications. Since the designs
	deliberately vary the analyte levels over a wide range, issues of
	variance dependent on mean, calibrations of differing slopes, and
	curvature all need to be added to the usual model assumptions such
	as normality. Violations in any of these assumptions invalidate the
	conventional matched pairs analysis. A graphical method, due to Bland
	and Altman, of looking at the relationship between the average and
	the difference of the members of the pairs is shown to correspond
	to a formal testable regression model. Using standard regression
	diagnostics, one may detect and diagnose departures from the model
	assumptions and remedy them – for example using variable transformations.
	Examples of different common scenarios and possible approaches to
	handling them are shown.},

  abstract = {This article addresses the problem of choosing weights for iterative
	weighted least squares estimation in heteroscedastic linear models.
	An asymptotically optimal method for determining weights at each
	iteration is derived under a Bayesian model for the variances. The
	method uses a compromise between model-based and model-free variance
	estimates. Consider a heteroscedastic linear regression model in
	which responses are grouped so that the variance is constant within
	each group. Let $\beta$ denote the vector of regression parameters
	and let $\theta$ denote a vector of parameters determining a prior
	distribution for the variances. Iterative weighted least squares
	estimators are defined as follows. Given estimates $\hat{\beta}$
	and $\hat{\theta}$, calculate a weight for the $i$th group as a function
	of $\hat{\theta}$, the values in the $i$th group of the predictor
	variables, and the average of the squared residuals from the estimated
	mean responses in the $i$th group. Given weights, calculate the weighted
	least squares estimate $\hat{\beta}$ and a new estimate $\hat{\theta}$.
	Continue until $\hat{\beta}$ converges. We derive the asymptotically
	optimal weight function under an inverse gamma model for the variances.
	The resulting weights have a simple form. At each iteration the inverse
	weight for the $i$th group is a weighted average of the average squared
	residual and a variance estimate based on the inverse gamma model.},

  title = {Methods for Accurate Analysis of High-Throughput Transcriptome Data},
  school = {North Carolina State University},
  year = {2009},
  month = {Oct},
  abstract = {A detailed understanding of the transcriptome is a prerequisite for
	deciphering the flow of information from genotype to phenotype. Fortunately,
	modern high-throughput technologies now provide an unprecedented
	ability to observe the full complement of transcriptional events,
	which extend far beyond the classical "one gene, one protein" hypothesis
	to include alternatively spliced genes, microRNAs, RNA interference,
	anti-sense transcription, and a variety of other, until recently,
	unknown phenomena. However, in order to accurately interpret the
	results of these assays, new statistical and bioinformatic methods
	must be developed in parallel to biotechnological advances. In this
	thesis, we present several methods for improving the accuracy of
	inferences obtained from the high-throughput transcriptome data generated
	by these new technologies.
	
	
	First, we present a novel method for microarray quality assessment.
	Since accurate inference is dependent on the quality of the underlying
	data, quality assessment is a critical component in any microarray
	data analysis. Our method, which uses an unsupervised classifier
	to discriminate between high and low quality microarray datasets,
	exhibits performance comparable to supervised learners constructed
	using the same training data. However, because our approach requires
	only unnannotated data, it is easy to customize and to keep up-to-date
	as technology evolves.
	
	
	Next, we present an alternative method for microarray quality assessment,
	which identifies low quality microarrays by simulating a set of differentially
	expressed genes. This method directly measures the ability of a planned
	statistical analysis to identify differential gene expression when
	suspected low quality arrays are included in the dataset. A key advantage
	of this approach is that, unlike other methods, this method provides
	a specific recommendation about whether to retain or discard low
	quality chips in the context of a particular experimental setting.
	
	
	Finally, we introduce a procedure for accurately quantifying alternative
	splicing using RNA-Seq data. Our method uses a familiar linear models
	approach, but improves upon similar methods that assume uniform coverage
	of RNA-Seq reads along the targeted transcripts. We first show, through
	simulation, that using an incorrect read sampling distribution can
	lead to incorrect conclusions about the expression of isoforms in
	a mixture. Applying our method to an example dataset, we identify
	438 differentially spliced genes, exhibiting a range of expression
	patterns including genes with switch-like differential splicing between
	two tissues, as well as genes with more subtle variations in isoform
	expression.
	
	
	Taken together, we expect that these methods can serve to increase
	the accuracy of inferences drawn from high-throughput transcriptome
	data, and in doing so, lead to an advancement of our understanding
	of the biology of genome expression.},

	RESULTS: We show how an unsupervised classification technique based

	method is flexible and can be easily adapted to accommodate alternate
	quality statistics and platforms. We evaluate our approach using

	of this method to a similar supervised approach. CONCLUSION: This

	approach for the purpose of automated microarray data quality assessment.

	a high-throughput, high-resolution method to measure relative changes
	in DNA copy number simultaneously at thousands of genomic loci. Typically,
	these measurements are reported and displayed linearly on chromosome
	maps, and gains and losses are detected as deviations from normal

	to uncover the true copy number changes before drawing inferences
	on the patterns of aberrations in the samples. Nonparametric techniques
	are particularly suitable for data denoising as they do not impose
	a parametric model in finding structures in the data. In this paper,
	we employ wavelets to denoise the data as wavelets have sound theoretical
	properties and a fast computational algorithm, and are particularly
	well suited for handling the abrupt changes seen in array-CGH data.
	A simulation study shows that denoising data prior to testing can
	achieve greater power in detecting the aberrant spot than using the

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: DNA copy number alterations are one of the main characteristics
	of the cancer cell karyotype and can contribute to the complex phenotype
	of these cells. These alterations can lead to gains in cellular oncogenes
	as well as losses in tumor suppressor genes and can span small intervals
	as well as involve entire chromosomes. The ability to accurately
	detect these changes is central to understanding how they impact
	the biology of the cell. RESULTS: We describe a novel algorithm called
	CARAT (Copy Number Analysis with Regression And Tree) that uses probe
	intensity information to infer copy number in an allele-specific
	manner from high density DNA oligonuceotide arrays designed to genotype
	over 100,000 SNPs. Total and allele-specific copy number estimations
	using CARAT are independently evaluated for a subset of SNPs using
	quantitative PCR and allelic TaqMan reactions with several human
	breast cancer cell lines. The sensitivity and specificity of the
	algorithm are characterized using DNA samples containing differing
	numbers of X chromosomes as well as a test set of normal individuals.
	Results from the algorithm show a high degree of agreement with results
	from independent verification methods. CONCLUSION: Overall, CARAT
	automatically detects regions with copy number variations and assigns
	a significance score to each alteration as well as generating allele-specific
	output. When coupled with SNP genotype calls from the same array,
	CARAT provides additional detail into the structure of genome wide
	alterations that can contribute to allelic imbalance.},

  abstract = {Changes in DNA copy number are one of the hallmarks of the genetic
	instability common to most human cancers. Previous microarray-based
	methods have been used to identify chromosomal gains and losses;
	however, they are unable to genotype alleles at the level of single
	nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Here we describe a novel algorithm
	that uses a recently developed high-density oligonucleotide array-based
	SNP genotyping method, whole genome sampling analysis (WGSA), to
	identify genome-wide chromosomal gains and losses at high resolution.
	WGSA simultaneously genotypes over 10,000 SNPs by allele-specific
	hybridisation to perfect match (PM) and mismatch (MM) probes synthesised
	on a single array. The copy number algorithm jointly uses PM intensity
	and discrimination ratios between paired PM and MM intensity values
	to identify and estimate genetic copy number changes. Values from
	an experimental sample are compared with SNP-specific distributions
	derived from a reference set containing over 100 normal individuals
	to gain statistical power. Genomic regions with statistically significant
	copy number changes can be identified using both single point analysis
	and contiguous point analysis of SNP intensities. We identified multiple
	regions of amplification and deletion using a panel of human breast
	cancer cell lines. We verified these results using an independent
	method based on quantitative polymerase chain reaction and found
	that our approach is both sensitive and specific and can tolerate
	samples which contain a mixture of both tumour and normal DNA. In
	addition, by using known allele frequencies from the reference set,
	statistically significant genomic intervals can be identified containing
	contiguous stretches of homozygous markers, potentially allowing
	the detection of regions undergoing loss of heterozygosity (LOH)
	without the need for a matched normal control sample. The coupling
	of LOH analysis, via SNP genotyping, with copy number estimations
	using a single array provides additional insight into the structure
	of genomic alterations. With mean and median inter-SNP euchromatin
	distances of 244 kilobases (kb) and 119 kb, respectively, this method
	affords a resolution that is not easily achievable with non-oligonucleotide-based
	experimental approaches.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: High throughput microarray-based single nucleotide polymorphism
	(SNP) genotyping has revolutionized the way genome-wide linkage scans
	and association analyses are performed. One of the key features of
	the array-based GeneChip Mapping 10K Array from Affymetrix is the
	automated SNP calling algorithm. The Affymetrix algorithm was trained
	on a database of ethnically diverse DNA samples to create SNP call
	zones that are used as static models to make genotype calls for experimental
	data. We describe here the implementation of clustering algorithms
	on large training datasets resulting in improved SNP call rates on
	the 10K GeneChip. RESULTS: A database of 948 individuals genotyped
	on the GeneChip Mapping 10K 2.0 Array was used to identify 822 SNPs
	that were called consistently less than 75\% of the time. These SNPs
	represent on average 8.25\% of the total SNPs on each chromosome
	with chromosome 19, the most gene-rich chromosome, containing the
	highest proportion of poor performers (18.7\%). To remedy this, we
	created SNiPer, a new application which uses two clustering algorithms
	to yield increased call rates and equivalent concordance to Affymetrix
	called genotypes. We include a training set for these algorithms
	based on individual genotypes for 705 samples. SNiPer has the capability
	to be retrained for lab-specific training sets. SNiPer is freely
	available for download at http://www.tgen.org/neurogenomics/data.
	CONCLUSION: The correct calling of poor performing SNPs may prove
	to be key in future linkage studies performed on the 10K GeneChip.
	It would prove particularly invaluable for those diseases that map
	to chromosome 19, known to contain a high proportion of poorly performing
	SNPs. Our results illustrate that SNiPer can be used to increase
	call rates on the 10K GeneChip without sacrificing accuracy, thereby
	increasing the amount of valid data generated.},

	A webtool was made available for developers to benchmark their procedures.
	At the time of writing over 50 methods had been submitted. RESULTS:
	We benchmarked 31 probe set algorithms using a U95A dataset of spike
	in controls. Using this dataset, we found that background correction,
	one of the main steps in preprocessing, has the largest effect on
	performance. In particular, background correction appears to improve
	accuracy but, in general, worsen precision. The benchmark results
	put this balance in perspective. Furthermore, we have improved some
	of the original benchmark metrics to provide more detailed information
	regarding precision and accuracy. A handful of methods stand out
	as providing the best balance using spike-in data with the older
	U95A array, although different experiments on more current arrays
	may benchmark differently. AVAILABILITY: The affycomp package, now

  abstract = {In this paper we report exploratory analyses of high-density oligonucleotide
	array data from the Affymetrix GeneChip system with the objective
	of improving upon currently used measures of gene expression. Our
	analyses make use of three data sets: a small experimental study
	consisting of 5 MGU74A mouse GeneChip arrays, part of the data from
	an extensive spike-in study conducted by Gene Logic andWyeth’s Genetics
	Institute involving 95 HG-U95A human GeneChip arrays; and part of
	a dilution study conducted by Gene Logic involving 75 HG-U95A GeneChip
	arrays. We display some familiar features of the perfect match and
	mismatch probe (PM and MM) values of these data, and examine the
	variance-mean relationship with probe-level data from probes believed
	to be defective, and so delivering noise only. We explain why we
	need to normalize the arrays to one another using probe level intensities.
	We then examine the behavior of the PM and MM using spike-in data
	and assess three commonly used summary measures: Affymetrix’s i)
	average difference (AvDiff) and ii) MAS 5.0 signal, and iii) the
	Li and Wong multiplicative model-based expression index (MBEI). The
	exploratory data analyses of the probe level data motivate a new
	summary measure that is a robust multi-array average (RMA) of background
	adjusted, normalized, and log transformed PM values. We evaluate
	the four expression summary measures using the dilution study data,
	assessing their behavior in terms of bias, variance and (for MBEI
	and RMA) model fit. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms in terms
	of their ability to detect known levels of differential expression
	using the spike-in data. We conclude that there is no obvious downside
	to using RMA and attaching a standard error (SE) to this quantity
	using a linear model which removes probe-specific affinities. An
	R package with the functions used for the analyses in this paper

	for ex vivo analysis is often limited because large parts of many

	ultrasonic tumor aspirates as a biosource to study immune suppressive
	mechanisms in 83 human brain tumors. Lymphocyte infiltrates in brain
	tumor tissues and ultrasonic aspirates were comparable with respect
	to lymphocyte content and viability. Applying ultrasonic aspirates,
	we detected massive infiltration of CD4+FoxP3+CD25(high) CD127(low)
	regulatory T cells (Tregs) in glioblastomas (n = 29) and metastatic
	brain tumors (n = 20). No Treg accumulation was observed in benign
	tumors such as meningiomas (n = 10) and pituitary adenomas (n = 5).
	A significant Treg increase in blood was seen only in patients with
	metastatic brain tumors. Tregs in high-grade tumors exhibited an
	activated phenotype as indicated by decreased proliferation and elevated
	CTLA-4 and FoxP3 expression relative to blood Tregs. Functional analysis
	showed that the tumor-derived Tregs efficiently suppressed cytokine
	secretion and proliferation of autologous intratumoral lymphocytes.
	Most tumor-infiltrating Tregs were localized in close proximity to
	effector T cells, as visualized by immunohistochemistry. Furthermore,
	61\% of the malignant brain tumors expressed programmed death ligand-1
	(PD-L1), while the inhibitory PD-1 receptor was expressed on CD4+
	effector cells present in 26\% of tumors. In conclusion, using ultrasonic
	tumor aspirates as a biosource we identified Tregs and the PD-L1/PD-1

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Microarray designs have become increasingly proberich,
	enabling targeting of specific features, such as individual exons
	or SNPs. These arrays have the potential to achieve quantitative
	highthroughput estimates of transcript abundances, but currently
	these estimates are affected by biases due to cross-hybridization,
	in which probes hybridize to off-target transcripts. RESULTS: To
	study cross-hybridization, we map Affymetrix exon array probes to
	a set of annotated mRNA transcripts, allowing a small number of mismatches
	or insertion-deletions between the two sequences. Based on a systematic
	study of the degree to which probes with a given match type to a
	transcript are affected by cross-hybridization, we developed a strategy
	to correct for crosshybridization biases of gene-level expression
	estimates. Comparison with Solexa ultra-high-throughput sequencing
	data demonstrates that correction for cross-hybridization leads to
	a significant improvement of gene expression estimates. AVAILABILITY:
	We provide mappings between human and mouse exon array probes and
	off-target transcripts and provide software extending the GeneBASE
	program for generating gene-level expression estimates including
	the cross-hybridization correction http://biogibbs.stanford.edu/~kkapur/GeneBase/.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genotyping technology has advanced such that genome-wide
	association studies of complex diseases based upon dense marker maps
	are now technically feasible. However, the cost of such projects
	remains high. Pooled DNA genotyping offers the possibility of applying
	the same technologies at a fraction of the cost, and there is some
	evidence that certain ultra-high throughput platforms also perform
	with an acceptable accuracy. However, thus far, this conclusion is
	based upon published data concerning only a small number of SNPs.
	RESULTS: In the current study we prepared DNA pools from the parents
	and from the offspring of 30 parent-child trios that have been extensively
	genotyped by the HapMap project. We analysed the two pools with Affymetrix
	10 K Xba 142 2.0 Arrays. The availability of the HapMap data allowed
	us to validate the performance of 6843 SNPs for which we had both
	complete individual and pooled genotyping data. Pooled analyses averaged
	over 5-6 microarrays resulted in highly reproducible results. Moreover,
	the accuracy of estimating differences in allele frequency between
	pools using this ultra-high throughput system was comparable with
	previous reports of pooling based upon lower throughput platforms,
	with an average error for the predicted allelic frequencies differences
	between the two pools of 1.37\% and with 95\% of SNPs showing an
	error of < 3.2\%. CONCLUSION: Genotyping thousands of SNPs with DNA
	pooling using Affymetrix microarrays produces highly accurate results

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cervical carcinoma develops as a result of multiple genetic
	alterations. Different studies investigated genomic alterations in
	cervical cancer mainly by means of metaphase comparative genomic
	hybridization (mCGH) and microsatellite marker analysis for the detection
	of loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Currently, high throughput methods
	such as array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH), single
	nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP array) and gene expression arrays
	are available to study genome-wide alterations. Integration of these
	3 platforms allows detection of genomic alterations at high resolution
	and investigation of an association between copy number changes and
	expression. RESULTS: Genome-wide copy number and genotype analysis
	of 10 cervical cancer cell lines by array CGH and SNP array showed
	highly complex large-scale alterations. A comparison between array
	CGH and SNP array revealed that the overall concordance in detection
	of the same areas with copy number alterations (CNA) was above 90\%.
	The use of SNP arrays demonstrated that about 75\% of LOH events
	would not have been found by methods which screen for copy number
	changes, such as array CGH, since these were LOH events without CNA.
	Regions frequently targeted by CNA, as determined by array CGH, such
	as amplification of 5p and 20q, and loss of 8p were confirmed by
	fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Genome-wide, we did not
	find a correlation between copy-number and gene expression. At chromosome
	arm 5p however, 22\% of the genes were significantly upregulated
	in cell lines with amplifications as compared to cell lines without
	amplifications, as measured by gene expression arrays. For 3 genes,
	SKP2, ANKH and TRIO, expression differences were confirmed by quantitative
	real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). CONCLUSION: This study showed that copy
	number data retrieved from either array CGH or SNP array are comparable
	and that the integration of genome-wide LOH, copy number and gene
	expression is useful for the identification of gene specific targets
	that could be relevant for the development and progression in cervical

	estimating the allele-specific affinity as well as to reduce signal
	noise by incorporating probe and target sequence characteristics
	via an improved version of the Genomic Imbalance Map (GIM) algorithm;

	in which all pairwise comparisons are summarized to more precisely
	define CNV boundaries and accurately estimate CNV copy number. Independent
	testing of a subset of CNVs by quantitative PCR and mass spectrometry
	demonstrated a >90\% verification rate. The use of high-resolution
	oligonucleotide arrays relative to other methods may allow more precise
	boundary information to be extracted, thereby enabling a more accurate
	analysis of the relationship between CNVs and other genomic features.},

	are hallmarks of cancer. In recent years a variety of studies have
	emerged measuring total chromosomal copy number at increasingly high

	mapped using high-throughput genotyping technologies. We have developed
	a probe-level allele-specific quantitation procedure that extracts
	both copy number and allelotype information from single nucleotide
	polymorphism (SNP) array data to arrive at allele-specific copy number
	across the genome. Our approach applies an expectation-maximization

	probes. This method is the first to our knowledge that is able to
	(a) determine the generalized genotype of aberrant samples at each
	SNP site (e.g., CCCCT at an amplified site), and (b) infer the copy
	number of each parental chromosome across the genome. With this method,
	we are able to determine not just where amplifications and deletions
	occur, but also the haplotype of the region being amplified or deleted.
	The merit of our model and general approach is demonstrated by very
	precise genotyping of normal samples, and our allele-specific copy
	number inferences are validated using PCR experiments. Applying our
	method to a collection of lung cancer samples, we are able to conclude
	that amplification is essentially monoallelic, as would be expected
	under the mechanisms currently believed responsible for gene amplification.
	This suggests that a specific parental chromosome may be targeted
	for amplification, whether because of germ line or somatic variation.

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: DNA copy number aberration--both inherited and sporadic--is
	a significant contributor to a variety of human diseases. Copy number
	characterization is therefore an area of intense research. Probe
	hybridization-based arrays are important tools used to measure copy
	number in a high-throughput manner. RESULTS: In this article, we
	present a simple but powerful nonparametric rank-based approach to
	detect deletions and gains from raw array copy number measurements.
	We use three different rank-based statistics to detect three separate
	molecular phenomena-somatic lesions, germline deletions and germline
	gains. The approach is robust and rigorously grounded in statistical
	theory, thereby enabling the meaningful assignment of statistical
	significance to each putative aberration. We demonstrate the flexibility
	of our approach by applying it to data from three different array
	platforms. We show that our method compares favorably with established
	approaches by applying it to published well-characterized samples.
	Power simulations demonstrate exquisite sensitivity for array data
	of reasonable quality. CONCLUSIONS: Our flexible rank-based framework
	is suitable for multiple platforms including single nucleotide polymorphism
	arrays and array comparative genomic hybridization, and can reliably
	detect gains or losses of genomic DNA, whether inherited, de novo,

	of the underlying chromosome copy numbers from the log fluorescence
	ratios and segmenting the chromosome into regions with the same copy
	number at each location. We propose for the analysis of array-CGH
	data, a new stochastic segmentation model and an associated estimation
	procedure that has attractive statistical and computational properties.
	An important benefit of this Bayesian segmentation model is that
	it yields explicit formulas for posterior means, which can be used
	to estimate the signal directly without performing segmentation.
	Other quantities relating to the posterior distribution that are
	useful for providing confidence assessments of any given segmentation
	can also be estimated by using our method. We propose an approximation
	method whose computation time is linear in sequence length which
	makes our method practically applicable to the new higher density
	arrays. Simulation studies and applications to real array-CGH data
	illustrate the advantages of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY: Accurate estimation of DNA copy numbers from array comparative
	genomic hybridization (CGH) data is important for characterizing
	the cancer genome. An important part of this process is the segmentation
	of the log-ratios between the sample and control DNA along the chromosome
	into regions of different copy numbers. However, multiple algorithms
	are available in the literature for this procedure and the results
	can vary substantially among these. Thus, a visualization tool that
	can display the segmented profiles from a number of methods can be
	helpful to the biologist or the clinician to ascertain that a feature
	of interest did not arise as an artifact of the algorithm. Such a
	tool also allows the methodologist to easily contrast his method
	against others. We developed a web-based tool that applies a number
	of popular algorithms to a single array CGH profile entered by the
	user. It generates a heatmap panel of the segmented profiles for
	each method as well as a consensus profile. The clickable heatmap
	can be moved along the chromosome and zoomed in or out. It also displays
	the time that each algorithm took and provides numerical values of
	the segmented profiles for download. The web interface calls algorithms
	written in the statistical language R.We encourage developers of
	new algorithms to submit their routines to be incorporated into the

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Affymetrix SNP arrays can interrogate thousands of SNPs
	at the same time. This allows us to look at the genomic content of
	cancer cells and to investigate the underlying events leading to
	cancer. Genomic copy-numbers are today routinely derived from SNP
	array data, but the proposed algorithms for this task most often
	disregard the genotype information available from germline cells
	in paired germline-tumour samples. Including this information may
	deepen our understanding of the "true" biological situation e.g.
	by enabling analysis of allele specific copy-numbers. Here we rely
	on matched germline-tumour samples and have developed a Hidden Markov
	Model (HMM) to estimate allelic copy-number changes in tumour cells.
	Further with this approach we are able to estimate the proportion
	of normal cells in the tumour (mixture proportion). RESULTS: We show
	that our method is able to recover the underlying copy-number changes
	in simulated data sets with high accuracy (above 97.71\%). Moreover,
	although the known copy-numbers could be well recovered in simulated
	cancer samples with more than 70\% cancer cells (and less than 30\%
	normal cells), we demonstrate that including the mixture proportion
	in the HMM increases the accuracy of the method. Finally, the method
	is tested on HapMap samples and on bladder and prostate cancer samples.
	CONCLUSION: The HMM method developed here uses the genotype calls
	of germline DNA and the allelic SNP intensities from the tumour DNA
	to estimate allelic copy-numbers (including changes) in the tumour.
	It differentiates between different events like uniparental disomy
	and allelic imbalances. Moreover, the HMM can estimate the mixture
	proportion, and thus inform about the purity of the tumour sample.},

	The latter point allows us to annotate SNPs that have poor performance,

	Generally, our method agrees well with a method developed by Affymetrix.

	An analysis is characterized by its ability to identify differentially
	expressed genes (its sensitivity) and its ability to provide unbiased

	microarray experiments regularly underestimate the true regulation
	of differentially expressed genes. We introduce the MC-normalization,
	where C stands for channel-wise normalization, with considerably
	lower bias than the commonly used standard methods. The idea behind
	the MC-normalization is that the channels' individual intensities
	determine the correction, rather than the average intensity which
	is the case for the widely used MA-normalization. The two methods
	were evaluated using spike-in data from an in-house produced cDNA-experiment
	and a publicly available Agilent-experiment. The methods were applied
	on background corrected and non-background corrected data. For the
	cDNA-experiment the methods were either applied separately on data
	from each of the print-tips or applied on the complete array data.
	Altogether 24 analyses were evaluated. For each analysis the sensitivity,
	the bias and two variance measures were estimated.We prove that the
	MC-normalization has lower bias than the MA-normalization. The spike-in
	data confirmed the theoretical result and suggest that the difference
	is significant. Furthermore, the empirical data suggest that the
	MC-and MA-normalization have similar sensitivity. A striking result

	The formation of these partial hybrids results in a number of probes

  abstract = {Biotechnological inventions during the 20th century have resulted
	in a wide range of approaches for explorations in the functional
	genomics field. Microarray technology is one of the recent advances
	which have provided us with snapshots of which genes are expressed
	in cells of various tissues and diseases. Methods to obtain reliable
	microarray data are continuously being developed and improved to
	meet the demands of biological researchers.
	
	
	In this thesis microarrays have been used to investigate gene expression
	patterns in cancer research. Four studies in three different areas
	were carried out covering adrenocortical tumors, p53 target genes
	and a comparison of RNA amplification methods.
	
	
	Adrenocortical tumours are among the most common tumours with an incidence
	of 7-9%. Malignancy of these tumors is rare. Distinction between
	malignant and benign tumours is often difficult to establish which
	makes an improvement of diagnostic approaches important. To elucidate
	biological processes in adrenocortical tumour development and to
	examine if there is a molecular signature associated with malignancy,
	microarray analysis was performed on 29 adrenocortical tumors and
	four normal specimens. It was possible to classify malignant and
	benign samples based on the entire expression profile. A number of
	potential biomarkers was identified which will be further evaluated.
	
	
	P53 is a gene which is mutated in 50% of all cancers. Functional p53
	is a transcription factor which is activated upon cellular stress
	and DNA damage. Target genes are mainly involved in cell cycle arrest
	and apoptosis. In solid tumors cells are stressed by hypoxia. To
	examine which target genes p53 activate under hypoxic conditions
	a microarray study of the cell lines HCT116p53+/+ and HCT116p53-/-
	was performed. A set of novel potential p53 target genes was identified
	while many known target genes were found to be not transcriptionally
	activated during hypoxia. Follow up which was focused on how p53
	affected hypoxia induced apoptosis showed that the death receptor
	Fas was critical.
	
	
	When small amounts of tissue are available, amplification of the transcript
	population is necessary for microarray analysis. A new strategy for
	amplification based on PCR was evaluated and compared to a commercial
	in vitro transcription protocol. Both protocols produced reliable
	results. Advantages with the PCR based method are a lower cost and
	a high flexibility due to compatibility with both sense and antisense
	strand microarrays.},

  abstract = {DNA microarrays are powerful tools for quantifying gene expression
	patterns. However, obtaining reliable estimates of gene expression
	from raw measurements on microarrays presents several problems due
	to background contributions, nonspecific probe response, possible
	variation in probe sensitivities, and possible nonlinear responses
	of the probes to transcript concentration. In an effort to address
	the nonspecific response of probes, Affymetrix GeneChip arrays use
	two probes for each measurement. One of these probes, the mismatch
	(MM) probe, is intended to reflect the nonspecific response of the
	corresponding perfect match (PM) probe. However, the reliability
	of this approach has not been established by published experiments.
	Indeed, some research has shown that at high transcript concentrations,
	the nonspecific component of the PM signal is a negligible part of
	the MM signal. Five variations of a method to model and estimate
	levels of gene expression on Affymetrix chips, without the use of
	MM cells, are presented. To test the validity of the algorithms,
	six different concentrations of human liver cRNA were prepared. Each
	of these solutions was then hybridized on five Affymetrix hg95A arrays
	using five different scanners. The expression estimates obtained
	using each of the five algorithms bore a strong linear relationship
	to the cRNA concentrations, particularly at low cRNA concentrations.
	The five variations were applied to a Latin square data set and the
	results compared with those obtained using Affymetrix MAS 5.0 and
	using robust multichip analysis. R2 values obtained using the new
	techniques were comparable, while fold changes were superior.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: DNA copy number aberrations (CNAs) and gene expression
	(GE) changes provide valuable information for studying chromosomal
	instability and its consequences in cancer. While it is clear that
	the structural aberrations and the transcript levels are intertwined,
	their relationship is more complex and subtle than initially suspected.
	Most studies so far have focused on how a CNA affects the expression
	levels of those genes contained within that CNA. RESULTS: To better
	understand the impact of CNAs on expression, we investigated the
	correlation of each CNA to all other genes in the genome. The correlations
	are computed over multiple patients that have both expression and
	copy number measurements in brain, bladder, and breast cancer data
	sets. We find that a CNA has a direct impact on the gene amplified
	or deleted, but it also has a broad, indirect impact elsewhere. To
	identify a set of CNAs that is coordinately associated with the expression
	changes of a set of genes, we used a biclustering algorithm on the
	correlation matrix. for each of the three cancer types examined,
	the aberrations in several loci are associated with cancer-type specific
	biological pathways that have been described in the literature: CNAs
	of chromosome (chr) 7p13 were significantly correlated with epidermal
	growth factor receptor signaling pathway in glioblastoma multiforme,
	chr 13q with NF-kappaB cascades in bladder cancer, and chr 11p with
	Reck pathway in breast cancer. In all three data sets, gene sets
	related to cell cycle/division such as M phase, DNA replication,
	and cell division were also associated with CNAs. Our results suggest
	that CNAs are both directly and indirectly correlated with changes
	in expression and that it is beneficial to examine the indirect effects
	of CNAs. AVAILABILITY: The code is available upon request. CONTACT:

	produced from approximately 32 million random DNA fragments, sequenced
	by Sanger dideoxy technology and assembled into 4,528 scaffolds,
	comprising 2,810 million bases (Mb) of contiguous sequence with approximately
	7.5-fold coverage for any given region. We developed a modified version
	of the Celera assembler to facilitate the identification and comparison
	of alternate alleles within this individual diploid genome. Comparison
	of this genome and the National Center for Biotechnology Information
	human reference assembly revealed more than 4.1 million DNA variants,
	encompassing 12.3 Mb. These variants (of which 1,288,319 were novel)
	included 3,213,401 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 53,823
	block substitutions (2-206 bp), 292,102 heterozygous insertion/deletion
	events (indels)(1-571 bp), 559,473 homozygous indels (1-82,711 bp),
	90 inversions, as well as numerous segmental duplications and copy

	44\% of genes were heterozygous for one or more variants. Using a
	novel haplotype assembly strategy, we were able to span 1.5 Gb of
	genome sequence in segments >200 kb, providing further precision
	to the diploid nature of the genome. These data depict a definitive

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most common
	genetic variations in the human genome and are useful as genomic
	markers. Oligonucleotide SNP microarrays have been developed for
	high-throughput genotyping of up to 900,000 human SNPs and have been
	used widely in linkage and cancer genomics studies. We have previously
	used Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to analyze SNP array data for inferring
	copy numbers and loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) from paired normal
	and tumor samples and unpaired tumor samples. RESULTS: We proposed
	and implemented major copy proportion (MCP) analysis of oligonucleotide
	SNP array data. A HMM was constructed to infer unobserved MCP states
	from observed allele-specific signals through emission and transition
	distributions. We used 10 K, 100 K and 250 K SNP array datasets to
	compare MCP analysis with LOH and copy number analysis, and showed
	that MCP performs better than LOH analysis for allelic-imbalanced
	chromosome regions and normal contaminated samples. The major and
	minor copy alleles can also be inferred from allelic-imbalanced regions
	by MCP analysis. CONCLUSION: MCP extends tumor LOH analysis to allelic
	imbalance analysis and supplies complementary information to total
	copy numbers. MCP analysis of mixing normal and tumor samples suggests
	the utility of MCP analysis of normal-contaminated tumor samples.
	The described analysis and visualization methods are readily available

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: High throughput gene expression data from spotted cDNA
	microarrays are collected by scanning the signal intensities of the
	corresponding spots by dedicated fluorescence scanners. The major
	scanner settings for increasing the spot intensities are the laser
	power and the voltage of the photomultiplier tube (PMT). It is required
	that the expression ratios are independent of these settings. We
	have investigated the relationships between PMT voltage, spot intensities,
	and expression ratios for different scanners, in order to define
	an optimal scanning procedure. RESULTS: All scanners showed a limited
	intensity range from 200 to 50 000 (mean spot intensity), for which
	the expression ratios were independent of PMT voltage. This usable
	intensity range was considerably less than the maximum detection
	range of the PMTs. The use of spot and background intensities outside
	this range led to errors in the ratios. The errors at high intensities
	were caused by saturation of pixel intensities within the spots.
	An algorithm was developed to correct the intensities of these spots,
	and, hence, extend the upper limit of the usable intensity range.
	CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that the PMT voltage should be increased
	to avoid intensities of the weakest spots below the usable range,
	allowing the brightest spots to reach the level of saturation. Subsequently,
	a second set of images should be acquired with a lower PMT setting
	such that no pixels are in saturation. Reliable data for spots with
	saturation in the first set of images can easily be extracted from
	the second set of images by the use of our algorithm. This procedure
	would lead to an increase in the accuracy of the data and in the
	number of data points achieved in each experiment compared to traditional
	procedures.},

	ELB-Q, a large extended local background (ELB) interspot region excluding

	further excluding background pixels in these areas based on the cutoff
	values established during the ELB calculation. ELB-Q takes advantage
	of the abundant spatial information around each spot of interest,
	makes no assumption of the shape and size of the spots, and needs
	no sophisticated adjustment. We show results of image processing

	Neyman and Scott (1948) had demonstrated that maximum likelihood

	covariance matrix of the MLE is not equal to the inverse of the information

	(which include in particular the MLE) obtained via the usual likelihood
	approach when the incidental parameters are first replaced by their
	estimates (which are allowed to depend on the structural parameters).
	Conditions for consistency and asymptotic normality together with
	a proper formula for the asymptotic covariance matrix are given.
	The results are illustrated and applied to the problem of estimating
	linear functional relationships, and mild conditions on the incidental
	parameters for the MLE (or an adjusted MLE) to be consistent and
	asymptotically normal are obtained. These conditions are weaker than

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination has a central role in the evolution of sexually
	reproducing organisms. The two recombination outcomes, crossover
	and non-crossover, increase genetic diversity, but have the potential
	to homogenize alleles by gene conversion. Whereas crossover rates
	vary considerably across the genome, non-crossovers and gene conversions
	have only been identified in a handful of loci. To examine recombination
	genome wide and at high spatial resolution, we generated maps of
	crossovers, crossover-associated gene conversion and non-crossover
	gene conversion using dense genetic marker data collected from all
	four products of fifty-six yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) meioses.
	Our maps reveal differences in the distributions of crossovers and
	non-crossovers, showing more regions where either crossovers or non-crossovers
	are favoured than expected by chance. Furthermore, we detect evidence
	for interference between crossovers and non-crossovers, a phenomenon
	previously only known to occur between crossovers. Up to 1\% of the
	genome of each meiotic product is subject to gene conversion in a
	single meiosis, with detectable bias towards GC nucleotides. To our
	knowledge the maps represent the first high-resolution, genome-wide
	characterization of the multiple outcomes of recombination in any
	organism. In addition, because non-crossover hotspots create holes
	of reduced linkage within haplotype blocks, our results stress the
	need to incorporate non-crossovers into genetic linkage analysis.},

	one aspect of predictive ability. From the replicate study, the dendrimer
	method appeared to perform as well, and often better, with respect

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Large-scale high throughput studies using microarray technology
	have established that copy number variation (CNV) throughout the
	genome is more frequent than previously thought. Such variation is
	known to play an important role in the presence and development of
	phenotypes such as HIV-1 infection and Alzheimer's disease. However,
	methods for analyzing the complex data produced and identifying regions
	of CNV are still being refined. RESULTS: We describe the presence
	of a genome-wide technical artifact, spatial autocorrelation or 'wave',
	which occurs in a large dataset used to determine the location of
	CNV across the genome. By removing this artifact we are able to obtain
	both a more biologically meaningful clustering of the data and an
	increase in the number of CNVs identified by current calling methods
	without a major increase in the number of false positives detected.
	Moreover, removing this artifact is critical for the development
	of a novel model-based CNV calling algorithm - CNVmix - that uses
	cross-sample information to identify regions of the genome where
	CNVs occur. For regions of CNV that are identified by both CNVmix
	and current methods, we demonstrate that CNVmix is better able to
	categorize samples into groups that represent copy number gains or
	losses. CONCLUSION: Removing artifactual 'waves' (which appear to
	be a general feature of array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH)
	datasets) and using cross-sample information when identifying CNVs
	enables more biological information to be extracted from aCGH experiments
	designed to investigate copy number variation in normal individuals.},

	defined as solutions of the system: $\sum_i u_1(d_i)(\mathbf{x}_i

	Existence and uniqueness of solutions of this system are proved under
	general assumptions about the functions $u_1$ and $u_2$. Then the

	The breakdown bound and the influence function are calculated, showing

	numerical values of asymptotic variances, and Monte Carlo small-sample

	microarrays, we discovered 277 unbalanced CNVs in 44\% of ASD families
	not present in 500 controls (and re-examined in another 1152 controls).
	Karyotyping detected additional balanced changes. Although most variants
	were inherited, we found a total of 27 cases with de novo alterations,
	and in three (11\%) of these individuals, two or more new variants
	were observed. De novo CNVs were found in approximately 7\% and approximately
	2\% of idiopathic families having one child, or two or more ASD siblings,

	algorithm for Affymetrix and Nimblegen gene-expression microarrays.
	RMA performs background correction, normalization, and summarization
	in a modular way. The last two steps require multiple arrays to be
	analyzed simultaneously. The ability to borrow information across
	samples provides RMA various advantages. For example, the summarization
	step fits a parametric model that accounts for probe-effects, assumed
	to be fixed across arrays, and improves outlier detection. Residuals,
	obtained from the fitted model, permit the creation of useful quality
	metrics. However, the dependence on multiple arrays has two drawbacks:
	(1) RMA can- not be used in clinical settings where samples must
	be processed individu- ally or in small batches and (2) data sets
	preprocessed separately are not comparable. We propose a preprocessing
	algorithm, frozen RMA (fRMA), which allows one to analyze microarrays
	individually or in small batches and then combine the data for analysis.
	This is accomplished by utilizing information from the large publicly
	available microarray databases. In particular, estimates of probe-specific
	effects and variances are precomputed and frozen. Then, with new
	data sets, these are used in concert with information from the new
	array(s) to normalize and summarize the data. We find that fRMA is
	comparable to RMA when the data are analyzed as a single batch and
	outperforms RMA when analyzing multiple batches. The methods described
	here are implemented in the R package frma and are currently available
	for download from the software section of http://rafalab.jhsph.edu},

	this novel application by mapping whole genome histone H4 hyperacetylation

	The use of a SNP array for a ChIP-on-chip application (ChIP on SNP-chip)

	the adjustment is to alleviate some of the problems inherent in the
	use of profile likelihoods, such as bias, inconsistency and overoptimistic
	variance estimates. The adjustment is applied to the profile log-likelihood
	score function at each parameter value so that its mean is zero and
	its variance is the negative expected derivative matrix of the adjusted
	score function. For cases in which explicit calculation of the adjustments
	is difficult, we give two methods to simplify their computation:
	an `automatic' simulation method that requires as input only the
	profile log-likelihood and its first few derivatives; first-order
	asymptotic expressions. Some examples are provided and a comparison
	is made with the conditional profile log-likelihood of Cox and Reid.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The biomedical community is developing new methods of
	data analysis to more efficiently process the massive data sets produced
	by microarray experiments. Systematic and global mathematical approaches
	that can be readily applied to a large number of experimental designs
	become fundamental to correctly handle the otherwise overwhelming
	data sets. RESULTS: The gene selection model presented herein is
	based on the observation that: (1) variance of gene expression is
	a function of absolute expression; (2) one can model this relationship
	in order to set an appropriate lower fold change limit of significance;
	and (3) this relationship defines a function that can be used to
	select differentially expressed genes. The model first evaluates
	fold change (FC) across the entire range of absolute expression levels
	for any number of experimental conditions. Genes are systematically
	binned, and those genes within the top X\% of highest FCs for each
	bin are evaluated both with and without the use of replicates. A
	function is fitted through the top X\% of each bin, thereby defining
	a limit fold change. All genes selected by the 5\% FC model lie above
	measurement variability using a within standard deviation (SDwithin)
	confidence level of 99.9\%. Real time-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis demonstrated
	85.7\% concordance with microarray data selected by the limit function.
	CONCLUSION: The FC model can confidently select differentially expressed
	genes as corroborated by variance data and RT-PCR. The simplicity
	of the overall process permits selecting model limits that best describe
	experimental data by extracting information on gene expression patterns
	across the range of expression levels. Genes selected by this process
	can be consistently compared between experiments and enables the
	user to globally extract information with a high degree of confidence.},

  journal = {BMC Biotechnol},
  year = {2008},

  pages = {48},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The high binding specificity of short 10 to 30 mer oligonucleotide
	probes enables single base mismatch (MM) discrimination and thus
	provides the basis for genotyping and resequencing microarray applications.
	Recent experiments indicate that the underlying principles governing
	DNA microarray hybridization - and in particular MM discrimination
	- are not completely understood. Microarrays usually address complex
	mixtures of DNA targets. In order to reduce the level of complexity
	and to study the problem of surface-based hybridization with point
	defects in more detail, we performed array based hybridization experiments
	in well controlled and simple situations. RESULTS: We performed microarray
	hybridization experiments with short 16 to 40 mer target and probe
	lengths (in situations without competitive hybridization) in order
	to systematically investigate the impact of point-mutations - varying
	defect type and position - on the oligonucleotide duplex binding
	affinity. The influence of single base bulges and single base MMs
	depends predominantly on position - it is largest in the middle of
	the strand. The position-dependent influence of base bulges is very
	similar to that of single base MMs, however certain bulges give rise
	to an unexpectedly high binding affinity. Besides the defect (MM
	or bulge) type, which is the second contribution in importance to
	hybridization affinity, there is also a sequence dependence, which
	extends beyond the defect next-neighbor and which is difficult to
	quantify. Direct comparison between binding affinities of DNA/DNA
	and RNA/DNA duplexes shows, that RNA/DNA purine-purine MMs are more
	discriminating than corresponding DNA/DNA MMs. In DNA/DNA MM discrimination
	the affected base pair (C.G vs. A.T) is the pertinent parameter.
	We attribute these differences to the different structures of the
	duplexes (A vs. B form). CONCLUSION: We have shown that DNA microarrays
	can resolve even subtle changes in hybridization affinity for simple
	target mixtures. We have further shown that the impact of point defects
	on oligonucleotide stability can be broken down to a hierarchy of
	effects. In order to explain our observations we propose DNA molecular
	dynamics - in form of zipping of the oligonucleotide duplex - to
	play an important role.},

	116,204 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. The advantages of this algorithm
	include the improvement of signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios and the use
	of an optimized reference. The raw S/N ratios were improved by accounting
	for the length and GC content of the PCR products using quadratic
	regressions. The use of constitutional DNA, when available, gives
	the lowest SD values (0.16 +/- 0.03) and also enables allele-based
	copy number detection in cancer genomes, which can unmask otherwise
	concealed allelic imbalances. In the absence of constitutional DNA,
	optimized selection of multiple normal references with the highest
	S/N ratios, in combination with the data regressions, dramatically
	improves SD values from 0.67 +/- 0.12 to 0.18 +/- 0.03. These improvements
	allow for highly reliable comparison of data across different experimental
	conditions, detection of allele-based copy number changes, and more
	accurate estimations of the range and magnitude of copy number aberrations.

  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {7},
  pages = {264},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH)
	is a recently developed technique for analyzing changes in DNA copy
	number. As in all microarray analyses, normalization is required
	to correct for experimental artifacts while preserving the true biological
	signal. We investigated various sources of systematic variation in
	array-CGH data and identified two distinct types of spatial effect
	of no biological relevance as the predominant experimental artifacts:
	continuous spatial gradients and local spatial bias. Local spatial
	bias affects a large proportion of arrays, and has not previously
	been considered in array-CGH experiments. RESULTS: We show that existing
	normalization techniques do not correct these spatial effects properly.
	We therefore developed an automatic method for the spatial normalization
	of array-CGH data. This method makes it possible to delineate and
	to eliminate and/or correct areas affected by spatial bias. It is
	based on the combination of a spatial segmentation algorithm called
	NEM (Neighborhood Expectation Maximization) and spatial trend estimation.
	We defined quality criteria for array-CGH data, demonstrating significant
	improvements in data quality with our method for three data sets
	coming from two different platforms (198, 175 and 26 BAC-arrays).
	CONCLUSION: We have designed an automatic algorithm for the spatial
	normalization of BAC CGH-array data, preventing the misinterpretation
	of experimental artifacts as biologically relevant outliers in the
	genomic profile. This algorithm is implemented in the R package MANOR
	(Micro-Array NORmalization), which is described at http://bioinfo.curie.fr/projects/manor
	and available from the Bioconductor site http://www.bioconductor.org.
	It can also be tested on the CAPweb bioinformatics platform at http://bioinfo.curie.fr/CAPweb.},

  journal = {Mol Cancer},
  year = {2006},

  pages = {74},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Skin cancer accounts for 1/3 of all newly diagnosed cancer.
	Although seldom fatal, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is associated with
	severe disfigurement and morbidity. BCC has a unique interest for
	researchers, as although it is often locally invasive, it rarely
	metastasises. This paper, reporting the first whole genome expression
	microarray analysis of skin cancer, aimed to investigate the molecular
	profile of BCC in comparison to non-cancerous skin biopsies. RNA
	from BCC and normal skin specimens was analysed using Affymetrix
	whole genome microarrays. A Welch t-test was applied to data normalised
	using dCHIP to identify significant differentially-expressed genes
	between BCC and normal specimens. Principal component analysis and
	support vector machine analysis were performed on resulting genelists,
	Genmapp was used to identify pathways affected, and GOstat aided
	identification of areas of gene ontology more highly represented
	on these lists than would be expected by chance. RESULTS: Following
	normalisation, specimens clustered into groups of BCC specimens and
	of normal skin specimens. Of the 54,675 gene transcripts/variants
	analysed, 3,921 were differentially expressed between BCC and normal
	skin specimens. Of these, 2,108 were significantly up-regulated and
	1,813 were statistically significantly down-regulated in BCCs. CONCLUSION:
	Functional gene sets differentially expressed include those involved
	in transcription, proliferation, cell motility, apoptosis and metabolism.
	As expected, members of the Wnt and hedgehog pathways were found
	to be significantly different between BCC and normal specimens, as
	were many previously undescribed changes in gene expression between
	normal and BCC specimens, including basonuclin2 and mrp9. Quantitative-PCR
	analysis confirmed our microarray results, identifying novel potential
	biomarkers for BCC.},

  note = {(submitted)},
  month = {Feb},
  year = {2010},
  abstract = {Motivation:
	
	Current algorithms for estimating DNA copy numbers (CNs) borrow concepts
	from gene expression analysis methods. However, single nucleotide
	polymorphism (SNP) arrays have special characteristics that, if taken
	into account, can improve the overall performance. For example, cross
	hybridization between alleles occurs in SNP probe pairs. In addition,
	most of the current copy number methods are focused on total copy
	numbers while it has been shown that allele-specific copy numbers
	are of paramount importance for some studies. Therefore, we have
	developed a summarization method which estimates high-quality allele-specific
	copy numbers.
	
	
	Results:
	
	The proposed method estimates the allele-specific DNA copy numbers
	for all Affymetrix SNP arrays dealing directly with the cross hybridization
	between probes within SNP probesets. This algorithm outperforms (or
	at least it performs as well as) other state-of-the-art algorithms
	for computing DNA copy numbers. It better separates an aberration
	from a normal state and it also gives more precise allele-specific
	copy numbers.
	
	
	Availability:
	
	The method is available in the open-source R package ACNE, which is
	an add on to the aroma.affymetrix framework.},

  abstract = {The cellular and molecular microenvironment of epithelial stem and
	progenitor cells is poorly characterized despite well-documented
	roles in homeostatic tissue renewal, wound healing, and cancer progression.
	Here, we demonstrate that, in organotypic cocultures, dermal pericytes
	substantially enhanced the intrinsically low tissue-regenerative
	capacity of human epidermal cells that have committed to differentiate
	and that this enhancement was independent of angiogenesis. We used
	microarray analysis to identify genes expressed by human dermal pericytes
	that could potentially promote epidermal regeneration. Using this
	approach, we identified as a candidate the gene LAMA5, which encodes
	laminin alpha5, a subunit of the ECM component laminin-511/521 (LM-511/521).
	LAMA5 was of particular interest as we had previously shown that
	it promotes skin regeneration both in vitro and in vivo. Analysis
	using immunogold localization revealed that pericytes synthesized
	and secreted LAMA5 in human skin. Consistent with this observation,
	coculture with pericytes enhanced LM-511/521 deposition in the dermal-epidermal
	junction of organotypic cultures. We further showed that skin pericytes
	could also act as mesenchymal stem cells, exhibiting the capacity
	to differentiate into bone, fat, and cartilage lineages in vitro.
	This study suggests that pericytes represent a potent stem cell population
	in the skin that is capable of modifying the ECM microenvironment
	and promoting epidermal tissue renewal from non-stem cells, a previously
	unsuspected role for pericytes.},

	the emergence of solid tumors. Using a transgenic mouse model, we
	have tested the proposition that treatment with angiogenesis inhibitors
	can inhibit the progression of tumorigenesis after the switch to
	the angiogenic phenotype. In this model, islet cell carcinomas develop
	from multifocal, hyperproliferative nodules that show the histological
	hallmarks of human carcinoma in situ. Mice were treated with a combination
	of the angiogenesis inhibitor AGM-1470 (TNP-470), the antibiotic
	minocycline, and interferon alpha/beta. The treatment regimen markedly
	attenuated tumor growth but did not prevent tumor formation; tumor
	volume was reduced to 11\% and capillary density to 40\% of controls.
	The proliferation index of tumor cells in treated and control mice
	was similar, whereas the apoptotic index was doubled in treated tumors.
	This study shows that de novo tumor progression can be restricted
	solely by antiangiogenic therapy. The results suggest that angiogenesis
	inhibitors represent a valid component of anticancer strategies aimed
	at progression from discrete stages of tumorigenesis and demonstrate
	that transgenic mouse models can be used to evaluate efficacy of

	the expression levels of thousands of genes. A variety of approaches
	have been used, both in the implementation of this technology and
	in the analysis of the large amount of expression data. However,
	several practical issues still have not been resolved in a satisfactory
	manner, and among the most critical is the lack of agreement in the
	results obtained in different array platforms. In this study, we
	present a comparison of several microarray platforms [Affymetrix
	oligonucleotide arrays, custom complementary DNA (cDNA) arrays, and
	custom oligo arrays printed with oligonucleotides from three different
	sources] as well as analysis of various methods used for microarray
	target preparation and the reference design. The results indicate
	that the pairwise correlations of expression levels between platforms
	are relative low overall but that the log ratios of the highly expressed
	genes are strongly correlated, especially between Affymetrix and
	cDNA arrays. The microarray measurements were compared with quantitative
	real-time-polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) results for 23 genes,
	and the varying degrees of agreement for each platform were characterized.
	We have also developed and tested a double amplification method which
	allows the use of smaller amounts of starting material. The added
	round of amplification produced reproducible results as compared
	to the arrays hybridized with single round amplified targets. Finally,
	the reliability of using a universal RNA reference for two-channel
	microarrays was tested and the results suggest that comparisons of
	multiple experimental conditions using the same control can be accurate.},

	The introduction of high-density SNP genotyping technology to genomic

	measurement of both signal intensity variations and changes in allelic
	composition makes it possible to detect both copy number changes
	and copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) events. We demonstrate
	the utility of SNP-CGH with two Infinium whole-genome genotyping
	BeadChips, assaying 109,000 and 317,000 SNP loci, to detect chromosomal
	aberrations in samples bearing constitutional aberrations as well
	tumor samples at sub-100 kb effective resolution. Detected aberrations
	include homozygous deletions, hemizygous deletions, copy-neutral
	LOH, duplications, and amplifications. The statistical ability to
	detect common aberrations was modeled by analysis of an X chromosome
	titration model system, and sensitivity was modeled by titration
	of gDNA from a tumor cell with that of its paired normal cell line.
	Analysis was facilitated by using a genome browser that plots log
	ratios of normalized intensities and allelic ratios along the chromosomes.
	We developed two modes of SNP-CGH analysis, a single sample and a
	paired sample mode. The single sample mode computes log intensity
	ratios and allelic ratios by referencing to canonical genotype clusters
	generated from approximately 120 reference samples, whereas the paired
	sample mode uses a paired normal reference sample from the same individual.
	Finally, the two analysis modes are compared and contrasted for their

  abstract = {Background: Microarray-CGH experiments are used to detect and map
	chromosomal
	
	imbalances, by hybridizing targets of genomic DNA from a test and
	a reference sample to
	
	sequences immobilized on a slide. These probes are genomic DNA sequences
	(BACs) that are
	
	mapped on the genome. The signal has a spatial coherence that can
	be handled by specific statistical
	
	tools. Segmentation methods seem to be a natural framework for this
	purpose. A CGH profile can
	
	be viewed as a succession of segments that represent homogeneous regions
	in the genome whose
	
	BACs share the same relative copy number on average. We model a CGH
	profile by a random
	
	Gaussian process whose distribution parameters are affected by abrupt
	changes at unknown
	
	coordinates. Two major problems arise : to determine which parameters
	are affected by the abrupt
	
	changes (the mean and the variance, or the mean only), and the selection
	of the number of
	
	segments in the profile.
	
	
	Results: We demonstrate that existing methods for estimating the number
	of segments are not
	
	well adapted in the case of array CGH data, and we propose an adaptive
	criterion that detects
	
	previously mapped chromosomal aberrations. The performances of this
	method are discussed
	
	based on simulations and publicly available data sets. Then we discuss
	the choice of modeling for
	
	array CGH data and show that the model with a homogeneous variance
	is adapted to this context.
	
	
	Conclusions: Array CGH data analysis is an emerging field that needs
	appropriate statistical tools.
	
	Process segmentation and model selection provide a theoretical framework
	that allows precise
	
	biological interpretations. Adaptive methods for model selection give
	promising results concerning
	
	the estimation of the number of altered regions on the genome.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: The analysis of spotted cDNA microarrays involves scanning
	of color signals from fluorescent dyes. A common problem is that
	a given scanning intensity is not usually optimal for all spotted
	cDNAs. Specifically, some spots may be at the saturation limit, resulting
	in poor separation of signals from different tissues or conditions.
	The problem may be addressed by multiple scans with varying scanning
	intensities. Multiple scanning intensities raise the question of
	how to combine different signals from the same spot, particularly
	when measurement error is not negligible. RESULTS: This paper suggests
	a non-linear latent regression model for this purpose. It corrects
	for biases caused by the saturation limit and efficiently combines
	data from multiple scans. Combining multiple scans also allows reduction
	of technical error particularly for cDNA spots with low signal. The
	procedure is exemplified using cDNA expression data from maize. AVAILABILITY:

  abstract = {Gene dosage variations occur in many diseases. In cancer, deletions
	and copy number increases contribute to alterations in the expression
	of tumour-suppressor genes and oncogenes, respectively. Developmental
	abnormalities, such as Down, Prader Willi, Angelman and Cri du Chat
	syndromes, result from gain or loss of one copy of a chromosome or
	chromosomal region. Thus, detection and mapping of copy number abnormalities
	provide an approach for associating aberrations with disease phenotype
	and for localizing critical genes. Comparative genomic hybridization
	(CGH) was developed for genome-wide analysis of DNA sequence copy
	number in a single experiment. In CGH, differentially labelled total
	genomic DNA from a 'test' and a 'reference' cell population are cohybridized
	to normal metaphase chromosomes, using blocking DNA to suppress signals
	from repetitive sequences. The resulting ratio of the fluorescence
	intensities at a location on the 'cytogenetic map', provided by the
	chromosomes, is approximately proportional to the ratio of the copy
	numbers of the corresponding DNA sequences in the test and reference
	genomes. CGH has been broadly applied to human and mouse malignancies.
	The use of metaphase chromosomes, however, limits detection of events
	involving small regions (of less than 20 Mb) of the genome, resolution
	of closely spaced aberrations and linking ratio changes to genomic/genetic
	markers. Therefore, more laborious locus-by-locus techniques have
	been required for higher resolution studies. Hybridization to an
	array of mapped sequences instead of metaphase chromosomes could
	overcome the limitations of conventional CGH (ref. 6) if adequate
	performance could be achieved. Copy number would be related to the
	test/reference fluorescence ratio on the array targets, and genomic
	resolution could be determined by the map distance between the targets,
	or by the length of the cloned DNA segments. We describe here our
	implementation of array CGH. We demonstrate its ability to measure
	copy number with high precision in the human genome, and to analyse
	clinical specimens by obtaining new information on chromosome 20
	aberrations in breast cancer.},

  abstract = {A combination of genes, their epigenetic regulation, and the environment
	control the phenotypes of an individual, such as how short or tall
	one grows. Epigenetics refers to chemical modifications of DNA and
	histones that regulate gene activity and genome stability, and can
	take the form of, for example, addition of a methyl group to DNA.
	A rare but illustrative example of growth restriction is Silver-Russel
	syndrome (SRS), which also features a relatively large, triangular
	head and asymmetry between body halves. Molecular studies have demonstrated
	that SRS is an interesting model for how growth is controlled by
	both genetic architecture and epigenetics, and recurring findings
	include DNA hypomethylation at an imprinted region on chromosome
	11 (H19 ICR) in 20-65% of cases, maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome
	7 (matUPD7) in 5-15%, and rare maternal duplications of chromosomes
	7p and 11p. Imprinting is a rare but remarkable epigenetic phenomenon
	that describes parent-of-origin dependent gene activity, such that
	some genes are only expressed if they were inherited from, for example,
	the father. Differential DNA methylation (for example, maternal but
	not paternal methylation) is thought to regulate imprinting. All
	of the above mentioned molecular findings in SRS can cause dysregulation
	of imprinted genes. Interestingly, a large proportion of SRS patients
	remains molecularly unexplained.
	
	In this thesis we applied genome-wide genotyping and targeted epigenetic
	studies of imprinted genes to investigate the genetic nature of SRS
	and to disentangle the epi(genotype) and phenotype correlations in
	SRS and growth restriction. We devised a new approach to confirm
	UPD by the use of genotyping arrays and demonstrated a much increased
	resolution compared to the commonly used microsatellite markers.
	We further demonstrated the power of using genome-wide genotyping
	arrays in rare disorders such as SRS where UPD, copy number variants,
	or shared homozygosity might occur. We identified pathogenic submicroscopic
	events on chromosomes 15, 22, and X in molecularly unexplained SRS
	patients. A simple method for quantification of locus-specific DNA
	methylation is described and its accuracy and quantitative nature
	are demonstrated. In addition, reference distributions of DNA methylation
	at imprinted genes in controls are defined. This method was used
	to evaluate H19 ICR DNA methylation in SRS and isolated growth restriction,
	and 62% of SRS patients were hypomethylated. We further found a dose-response
	relationship between the degree of H19 ICR hypomethylation and phenotype
	severity in SRS and reported for the first time the association of
	specific anomalies of the spine, elbows, hands and feet, and genital
	defects in SRS with severe hypomethylation.
	
	
	In conclusion, we showed the utility of genotyping arrays to identify
	both UPD and submicroscopic genomic aberrations, and demonstrated
	that this genome-wide approach also enables the identification of
	important but unexpected events. Importantly, screens using genotyping
	arrays have the potential to detect the majority of genomic events
	in SRS. Through targeted epigenetic analysis we could conclude that
	H19 ICR methylation is clinically important as demonstrated by a
	strong correlation between the degree of hypomethylation and SRS
	phenotype severity and specifically associated clinical findings.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: The complexity of a large number of recently discovered
	copy number polymorphisms is much higher than initially thought,
	thus making it more difficult to detect them in the presence of significant
	measurement noise. In this scenario, separate normalization and segmentation
	is prone to lead to many false detections of changes in copy number.
	New approaches capable of jointly modeling the copy number and the
	non-copy number (noise) hybridization effects across multiple samples
	will potentially lead to more accurate results. METHODS: In this
	article, the genome alteration detection analysis (GADA) approach
	introduced in our previous work is extended to a multiple sample
	model. The copy number component is independent for each sample and
	uses a sparse Bayesian prior, while the reference hybridization level
	is not necessarily sparse but identical on all samples. The expectation
	maximization (EM) algorithm used to fit the model iteratively determines
	whether the observed hybridization levels are more likely due to
	a copy number variation or to a shared hybridization bias. RESULTS:
	The new proposed approach is compared with the currently used strategy
	of separate normalization followed by independent segmentation of
	each array. Real microarray data obtained from HapMap samples are
	randomly partitioned to create different reference sets. Using the
	new approach, copy number and reference intensity estimates are significantly
	less variable if the reference set changes; and a higher consistency
	on copy numbers detected within HapMap family trios is obtained.
	Finally, the running time to fit the model grows linearly in the
	number samples and probes. AVAILABILITY: http://biron.usc.edu/~piquereg/GADA.},

	technique has profound effect on subsequent statistical analyses,
	but there is no method to assess whether a particular technique is
	appropriate for a specific data set, without reference to external
	data. RESULTS: We analyzed coregulation between genes in order to
	detect insufficient normalization between arrays, where coregulation
	is measured in terms of statistical correlation. In a large collection
	of genes, a random pair of genes should have on average zero correlation,
	hence allowing a correlation test. For all data sets that we evaluated,
	and the three most commonly used low-level processing procedures
	including MAS5, RMA and MBEI, the housekeeping-gene normalization
	failed the test. For a real clinical data set, RMA and MBEI showed
	significant correlation for absent genes. We also found that a second
	round of normalization on the probe set level improved normalization
	significantly throughout. CONCLUSION: Previous evaluation of low-level
	processing in the literature has been limited to artificial spike-in
	and mixture data sets. In the absence of a known gold-standard, the
	correlation criterion allows us to assess the appropriateness of
	low-level processing of a specific data set and the success of normalization

	for analysis of CNVs in small samples such as microdissected tissues

	of such samples, whole genome amplification (WGA) techniques were
	developed. In this study, we explored the impact of Phi29 multiple-strand

	arrays. We extracted DNA from fresh frozen lymph node samples and
	used this for amplification and analysis on the Affymetrix Mapping

	detection of bona fide variants. Our analysis indicates that many
	artifacts are reproducible, and may correlate with proximity to chromosome
	ends and GC content. Pair-wise comparison of amplified products considerably
	reduced the number of apparent artifacts and partially restored the

	be appropriate for copy number analysis when amplified samples are

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are currently many different methods for processing
	and summarizing probe-level data from Affymetrix oligonucleotide
	arrays. It is of great interest to validate these methods and identify
	those that are most effective. There is no single best way to do
	this validation, and a variety of approaches is needed. Moreover,
	gene expression data are collected to answer a variety of scientific
	questions, and the same method may not be best for all questions.
	Only a handful of validation studies have been done so far, most
	of which rely on spike-in datasets and focus on the question of detecting
	differential expression. Here we seek methods that excel at estimating
	relative expression. We evaluate methods by identifying those that
	give the strongest linear association between expression measurements
	by array and the "gold-standard" assay. Quantitative reverse-transcription
	polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is generally considered the "gold-standard"
	assay for measuring gene expression by biologists and is often used
	to confirm findings from microarray data. Here we use qRT-PCR measurements
	to validate methods for the components of processing oligo array
	data: background adjustment, normalization, mismatch adjustment,
	and probeset summary. An advantage of our approach over spike-in
	studies is that methods are validated on a real dataset that was
	collected to address a scientific question. RESULTS: We initially
	identify three of six popular methods that consistently produced
	the best agreement between oligo array and RT-PCR data for medium-
	and high-intensity genes. The three methods are generally known as
	MAS5, gcRMA, and the dChip mismatch mode. For medium- and high-intensity
	genes, we identified use of data from mismatch probes (as in MAS5
	and dChip mismatch) and a sequence-based method of background adjustment
	(as in gcRMA) as the most important factors in methods' performances.
	However, we found poor reliability for methods using mismatch probes
	for low-intensity genes, which is in agreement with previous studies.
	CONCLUSION: We advocate use of sequence-based background adjustment
	in lieu of mismatch adjustment to achieve the best results across
	the intensity spectrum. No method of normalization or probeset summary
	showed any consistent advantages.},

	(G6PD) and "reductive stress" (Rajasekaran et al., Cell 130: 427-439,
	2007). However, the initiating molecular events in the pathogenesis
	of this novel toxic gain-of-function mechanism remain poorly defined.
	In an integrated systems approach using gene expression profiling,
	we identified a "biosignature," whose features can be validated to
	predict the onset, rate of progression, and clinical outcome of R120GCryAB
	cardiomyopathy. At the 3 mo disease-related but compensated stage,
	we demonstrate that transcripts were only upregulated in three distinct
	pathways: stress response (e.g., Hsp70, Hsp90), glutathione metabolism
	(Gpx1, Gpx3, glutathione S-transferase), and complement and coagulation
	cascades in hR120GCryAB transgenic mouse hearts compared with either
	hCryAB WT transgenic mice or nontransgenic controls. In 6 mo old
	myopathic hearts, ribosomal synthesis and cellular remodeling associated
	with increased cardiac hypertrophy were additional upregulated pathways.
	In contrast, the predominant downregulated pathways were for oxidative
	phosphorylation, fatty acid metabolism, intermediate metabolism,
	and energetic balance, supporting their primary pathogenic roles
	by which G6PD-dependent reductive stress causes cardiac decompensation
	and overt heart failure in hR120GCryAB cardiomyopathy. This study
	extends and confirms our previous findings that reductive stress
	is a causal mechanism for hR120G CryAB cardiomyopathy and demonstrates
	that alteration in glutathione pathway gene expression is an early
	biosignature with utility for presymptomatic detection.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chromosomal imbalances are a major cause of developmental
	defects as well as cancer and often constitute the key in identification
	of novel disease related genes. Classical cytogenetic methods are
	limited in resolution and dependent on highly skilled labour, while
	methods with higher resolution, based on molecular cytogenetics approaches
	such as matrix CGH, are not widely available. METHODS: We have developed
	and evaluated a method we term "molecular karyotyping", using readily
	available and easy to handle oligonucleotide arrays originally designed
	for parallel genomewide analysis of over 10,000 SNPs. We show that
	we can easily and reliably detect unbalanced chromosomal aberrations
	of various sizes from as little as 250 ng of DNA on a single microarray,
	based on fluorescence intensity information from clusters of SNPs.
	RESULTS: We determined the resolution of this method through analysis
	of 20 trios with 21 previously confirmed subtle aberrations sizing
	between 0.2 and 13 Mb. Duplications and deletions of at least 5 Mb
	in size were reliably detectable, but detection of smaller aberrations
	was dependent on the number of SNPs they contained, thus seven of
	10 different deletions analysed, with sizes ranging from 0.2 to 3.7
	Mb, were not detectable due to insufficient SNP densitiy in the respective
	region. CONCLUSIONS: Deduction of reliable cut off levels for array
	peaks in our series of well characterised patients allows the use
	of the GeneChip Mapping 10K SNP array for performing rapid molecular
	karyotyping from small amounts of DNA for the detection of even subtle
	deletions and duplications with high sensitivity and specificity.},

  month = {Jul},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quality-control is an important issue in the analysis
	of gene expression microarrays. One type of problem is regional bias,
	in which one region of a chip shows artifactually high or low intensities
	(or ratios in a two-channel array) relative to the majority of the
	chip. Current practice in quality assessment for microarrays does
	not address regional biases. RESULTS: We present methods implemented
	in R for visualizing regional biases and other spatial artifacts
	on spotted microarrays and Affymetrix chips. We also propose a statistical
	index to quantify regional bias and investigate its typical distribution
	on spotted and Affymetrix arrays. We demonstrate that notable regional
	biases occur on both Affymetrix and spotted arrays and that they
	can make a significant difference in the case of spotted microarray
	results. Although strong biases are also seen at the level of individual
	probes on Affymetrix chips, the gene expression measures are less
	affected, especially when the RMA method is used to summarize intensities
	for the probe sets. A web application program for visualization and
	quantitation of regional bias is provided at http://www.discover.nci.nih.gov/affytools.
	CONCLUSION: Researchers should visualize and measure the regional
	biases and should estimate their impact on gene expression measurements
	obtained. Here, we (i) introduce pictorial visualizations of the
	spatial biases; (ii) present for Affymetrix chips a useful resolution
	of the biases into two components, one related to background, the
	other to intensity scale factor; (iii) introduce a single parameter
	to reflect the global bias present across an array. We also examine
	the pattern distribution of such biases and conclude that algorithms

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Expression of the LIM-homeobox gene Lhx2 in murine hematopoietic
	cells allows for the generation of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-like
	cell lines. To address the molecular basis of Lhx2 function, we generated
	HSC-like cell lines where Lhx2 expression is regulated by a tet-on
	system and hence dependent on the presence of doxycyclin (dox). These
	cell lines efficiently down-regulate Lhx2 expression upon dox withdrawal
	leading to a rapid differentiation into various myeloid cell types.
	RESULTS: Global gene expression of these cell lines cultured in dox
	was compared to different time points after dox withdrawal using
	microarray technology. We identified 267 differentially expressed
	genes. The majority of the genes overlapping with HSC-specific databases
	were those down-regulated after turning off Lhx2 expression and a
	majority of the genes overlapping with those defined as late progenitor-specific
	genes were the up-regulated genes, suggesting that these cell lines
	represent a relevant model system for normal HSCs also at the level
	of global gene expression. Moreover, in situ hybridisations of several
	genes down-regulated after dox withdrawal showed overlapping expression
	patterns with Lhx2 in various tissues during embryonic development.
	CONCLUSION: Global gene expression analysis of HSC-like cell lines
	with inducible Lhx2 expression has identified genes putatively linked
	to self-renewal/differentiation of HSCs, and function of Lhx2 in
	organ development and stem/progenitor cells of non-hematopoietic

	copy number measurement of 11 000-500 000 SNPs along the genome.
	Their high density facilitates the precise localization of genomic
	alterations and makes them a powerful tool for studies of cancers
	and copy number polymorphism. Like other microarray technologies
	it is influenced by non-relevant sources of variation, requiring
	correction. Moreover, the amplitude of variation induced by non-relevant
	effects is similar or greater than the biologically relevant effect
	(i.e. true copy number), making it difficult to estimate non-relevant
	effects accurately without including the biologically relevant effect.
	RESULTS: We addressed this problem by developing ITALICS, a normalization
	method that estimates both biological and non-relevant effects in
	an alternate, iterative manner, accurately eliminating irrelevant
	effects. We compared our normalization method with other existing
	and available methods, and found that ITALICS outperformed these
	methods for several in-house datasets and one public dataset. These
	results were validated biologically by quantitative PCR. AVAILABILITY:

  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2009},
  volume = {10},
  pages = {156},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The latest generation of Affymetrix microarrays are designed
	to interrogate expression over the entire length of every locus,
	thus giving the opportunity to study alternative splicing genome-wide.
	The Exon 1.0 ST (sense target) platform, with versions for Human,
	Mouse and Rat, is designed primarily to probe every known or predicted
	exon. The smaller Gene 1.0 ST array is designed as an expression
	microarray but still interrogates expression with probes along the
	full length of each well-characterized transcript. We explore the
	possibility of using the Gene 1.0 ST platform to identify differential
	splicing events. RESULTS: We propose a strategy to score differential
	splicing by using the auxiliary information from fitting the statistical
	model, RMA (robust multichip analysis). RMA partitions the probe-level
	data into probe effects and expression levels, operating robustly
	so that if a small number of probes behave differently than the rest,
	they are downweighted in the fitting step. We argue that adjacent
	poorly fitting probes for a given sample can be evidence of differential
	splicing and have designed a statistic to search for this behaviour.
	Using a public tissue panel dataset, we show many examples of tissue-specific
	alternative splicing. Furthermore, we show that evidence for putative
	alternative splicing has a strong correspondence between the Gene
	1.0 ST and Exon 1.0 ST platforms. CONCLUSION: We propose a new approach,
	FIRMAGene, to search for differentially spliced genes using the Gene
	1.0 ST platform. Such an analysis complements the search for differential
	expression. We validate the method by illustrating several known
	examples and we note some of the challenges in interpreting the probe-level
	data.Software implementing our methods is freely available as an

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Affymetrix GeneChips are an important tool in many facets
	of biological research. Recently, notable design changes to the chips
	have been made. In this study, we use publicly available data from
	Affymetrix to gauge the performance of three human gene expression
	arrays: Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 (U133), Human Exon 1.0 ST (HuEx)
	and Human Gene 1.0 ST (HuGene). RESULTS: We studied probe-, exon-
	and gene-level reproducibility of technical and biological replicates
	from each of the 3 platforms. The U133 array has larger feature sizes
	so it is no surprise that probe-level variances are smaller, however
	the larger number of probes per gene on the HuGene array seems to
	produce gene-level summaries that have similar variances. The gene-level
	summaries of the HuEx array are less reproducible than the other
	two, despite having the largest average number of probes per gene.
	Greater than 80\% of the content on the HuEx arrays is expressed
	at or near background. Biological variation seems to have a smaller
	effect on U133 data. Comparing the overlap of differentially expressed
	genes, we see a high overall concordance among all 3 platforms, with
	HuEx and HuGene having greater overlap, as expected given their design.
	We performed an analysis of detection rates and area under ROC curves
	using an experiment made up of several mixtures of 2 human tissues.
	Though it appears that the HuEx array has worse performance in terms
	of detection rates, all arrays have similar ability to separate differentially
	expressed and non-differentially expressed genes. CONCLUSION: Despite
	noticeable differences in the probe-level reproducibility, gene-level
	reproducibility and differential expression detection are quite similar
	across the three platforms. The HuEx array, an all-encompassing array,
	has the flexibility of measuring all known or predicted exonic content.
	However, the HuEx array induces poorer reproducibility for genes
	with fewer exons. The HuGene measures just the well-annotated genome
	content and appears to perform well. The U133 array, though not able
	to measure across the full length of a transcript, appears to perform
	as well as the newer designs on the set of genes common to all 3
	platforms.},

	and novel methods for filtration, background adjustment, scanning,
	channel adjustment, and censoring. The S-plus package EDMA, a stand-alone
	tool providing characterization of analyzed cDNA-microarray data
	obtained from spike-in experiments, was developed and used to evaluate
	252 normalization methods. For all analyses, the sensitivities at
	low false positive rates were observed together with estimates of
	the overall bias and the standard deviation. In general, there was
	a trade-off between the ability of the analyses to identify differentially
	expressed genes (i.e. the analyses' sensitivities) and their ability
	to provide unbiased estimators of the desired ratios. Virtually all
	analysis underestimated the magnitude of the regulations; often less
	than 50\% of the true regulations were observed. Moreover, the bias
	depended on the underlying mRNA-concentration; low concentration
	resulted in high bias. Many of the analyses had relatively low sensitivities,
	but analyses that used either the constrained model (i.e. a procedure
	that combines data from several scans) or partial filtration (a novel
	method for treating data from so-called not-found spots) had with
	few exceptions high sensitivities. These methods gave considerable
	higher sensitivities than some commonly used analysis methods. CONCLUSION:
	The use of spike-in experiments is a powerful approach for evaluating
	microarray preprocessing procedures. Analyzed data are characterized
	by properties of the observed log-ratios and the analysis' ability
	to detect differentially expressed genes. If bias is not a major
	problem; we recommend the use of either the CM-procedure or partial
	filtration.},

	that the intracellular guanylic nucleotide pool was severely affected.
	In vivo studies of two AMPD homologs, Yjl070p and Ybr284p, indicate
	that these proteins have no detectable AMP, adenosine, or adenine
	deaminase activity; we show that overexpression of YJL070c instead
	mimics a loss of AMPD function. Expression of the yeast transcriptome
	was monitored in a AMPD-deficient mutant in a strain overexpressing
	YJL070c and in cells treated with the immunosuppressive drug mycophenolic
	acid, three conditions that lead to severe depletion of the guanylic
	nucleotide pool. These three conditions resulted in the up- or downregulation
	of multiple transcripts, 244 of which are common to at least two
	conditions and 71 to all three conditions. These transcriptome results,

  abstract = {Protein microarrays are similar to DNA microarrays; both enabling
	the parallel interrogation of thousands of probes immobilized on
	a surface. Consequently, they have benefited from technologies previously
	developed for DNA microarrays. However, assumptions for the analysis
	of DNA microarrays do not always translate to protein arrays, especially
	in the case of normalization. Hence, we have developed an experimental
	and computational framework to assess normalization procedures for
	protein microarrays. Specifically, we profiled two sera with markedly
	different autoantibody compositions. To analyze intra- and interarray
	variability, we compared a set of control proteins across subarrays
	and the corresponding spots across multiple arrays, respectively.
	To estimate the degree to which the normalization could help reveal
	true biological separability, we tested the difference in the signal
	between the sera relative to the variability within replicates. Next,
	by mixing the sera in different proportions (titrations), we correlated
	the reactivity of proteins with serum concentration. Finally, we
	analyzed the effect of normalization procedures on the list of reactive
	proteins. We compared global and quantile normalization, techniques
	that have traditionally been employed for DNA microarrays, with a
	novel normalization approach based on a robust linear model (RLM)
	making explicit use of control proteins. We show that RLM normalization
	is able to reduce both intra- and interarray technical variability
	while maintaining biological differences. Moreover, in titration
	experiments, RLM normalization enhances the correlation of protein
	signals with serum concentration. Conversely, while quantile and
	global normalization can reduce interarray technical variability,
	neither is as effective as RLM normalization in maintaining biological
	differences. Most importantly, both introduce artifacts that distort
	the signals and affect the correct identification of reactive proteins,
	impairing their use for biomarker discovery. Hence, we show RLM normalization
	is better suited to protein arrays than approaches used for DNA microarrays.},

	like copy number (CN) variation, gene expression (GE) or loss of
	heterocygosity has considerably increased in recent years, as well
	as the number of available datasets. This is particularly due to
	the success of microarray technology. Thus, to understand mechanisms
	of disease pathogenesis on a molecular basis, e.g. in cancer research,
	the challenge of analyzing such different data types in an integrated
	way has become increasingly important. In order to tackle this problem,
	we propose a new procedure for an integrated analysis of two different
	data types that searches for genes and genetic regions which for
	both inputs display strong equally directed deviations from the reference
	median. We employ this approach, based on a modified correlation
	coefficient and an explorative Wilcoxon test, to find DNA regions
	of such abnormalities in GE and CN (e.g. underexpressed genes accompanied
	by a loss of DNA material). RESULTS: In an application to acute myeloid
	leukemia, our procedure is able to identify various regions on different
	chromosomes with characteristic abnormalities in GE and CN data and
	shows a higher sensitivity to differences in abnormalities than standard
	approaches. While the results support various findings of previous
	studies, some new interesting DNA regions can be identified. In a
	simulation study, our procedure also shows more reliable results
	than standard approaches. AVAILABILITY: Code and data available as

	perturbed this permutation is relative to an unfolded chain. We show
	that the resultant topology provides improved association with folding
	and unfolding rates determined for a set of two-state proteins under

	the proposed geometry exhibits fine scale structure with respect

  abstract = {Diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive malignancy
	of mature B lymphocytes and is the most common type of lymphoma in
	adults. While treatment advances have been substantial in what was
	formerly a fatal disease, less than 50\% of patients achieve lasting
	remission. In an effort to predict treatment success and explain
	disease heterogeneity clinical features have been employed for prognostic
	purposes, but have yielded only modest predictive performance. This
	has spawned a series of high-profile microarray-based gene expression
	studies of DLBCL, in the hope that molecular-level information could
	be used to refine prognosis. The intent of this paper is to reevaluate
	these microarray-based prognostic assessments, and extend the statistical
	methodology that has been used in this context. Methodological challenges
	arise in using patients' gene expression profiles to predict survival
	endpoints on account of the large number of genes and their complex
	interdependence. We initially focus on the Lymphochip data and analysis
	of Rosenwald et al. (2002). After describing relationships between
	the analyses performed and gene harvesting (Hastie et al., 2001a),
	we argue for the utility of penalized approaches, in particular least
	angle regression-least absolute shrinkage and selection operator
	(Efron et al., 2004). While these techniques have been extended to
	the proportional hazards/partial likelihood framework, the resultant
	algorithms are computationally burdensome. We develop residual-based
	approximations that eliminate this burden yet perform similarly.
	Comparisons of predictive accuracy across both methods and studies
	are effected using time-dependent receiver operating characteristic
	curves. These indicate that gene expression data, in turn, only delivers
	modest predictions of posttherapy DLBCL survival. We conclude by
	outlining possibilities for further work.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Granulosa-cell tumors (GCTs) are the most common type
	of malignant ovarian sex cord-stromal tumor (SCST). The pathogenesis
	of these tumors is unknown. Moreover, their histopathological diagnosis
	can be challenging, and there is no curative treatment beyond surgery.
	METHODS: We analyzed four adult-type GCTs using whole-transcriptome
	paired-end RNA sequencing. We identified putative GCT-specific mutations
	that were present in at least three of these samples but were absent
	from the transcriptomes of 11 epithelial ovarian tumors, published
	human genomes, and databases of single-nucleotide polymorphisms.
	We confirmed these variants by direct sequencing of complementary
	DNA and genomic DNA. We then analyzed additional tumors and matched
	normal genomic DNA, using a combination of direct sequencing, analyses
	of restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms, and TaqMan assays.
	RESULTS: All four index GCTs had a missense point mutation, 402C-->G
	(C134W), in FOXL2, a gene encoding a transcription factor known to
	be critical for granulosa-cell development. The FOXL2 mutation was
	present in 86 of 89 additional adult-type GCTs (97\%), in 3 of 14
	thecomas (21\%), and in 1 of 10 juvenile-type GCTs (10\%). The mutation
	was absent in 49 SCSTs of other types and in 329 unrelated ovarian
	or breast tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Whole-transcriptome sequencing of
	four GCTs identified a single, recurrent somatic mutation (402C-->G)
	in FOXL2 that was present in almost all morphologically identified
	adult-type GCTs. Mutant FOXL2 is a potential driver in the pathogenesis
	of adult-type GCTs.},

  journal = {BMC Genet},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {9},
  pages = {27},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: DNA sequence diversity within the human genome may be
	more greatly affected by copy number variations (CNVs) than single
	nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Although the importance of CNVs
	in genome wide association studies (GWAS) is becoming widely accepted,
	the optimal methods for identifying these variants are still under
	evaluation. We have previously reported a comprehensive view of CNVs
	in the HapMap DNA collection using high density 500 K EA (Early Access)
	SNP genotyping arrays which revealed greater than 1,000 CNVs ranging
	in size from 1 kb to over 3 Mb. Although the arrays used most commonly
	for GWAS predominantly interrogate SNPs, CNV identification and detection
	does not necessarily require the use of DNA probes centered on polymorphic
	nucleotides and may even be hindered by the dependence on a successful
	SNP genotyping assay. RESULTS: In this study, we have designed and
	evaluated a high density array predicated on the use of non-polymorphic
	oligonucleotide probes for CNV detection. This approach effectively
	uncouples copy number detection from SNP genotyping and thus has
	the potential to significantly improve probe coverage for genome-wide
	CNV identification. This array, in conjunction with PCR-based, complexity-reduced
	DNA target, queries over 1.3 M independent NspI restriction enzyme
	fragments in the 200 bp to 1100 bp size range, which is a several
	fold increase in marker density as compared to the 500 K EA array.
	In addition, a novel algorithm was developed and validated to extract
	CNV regions and boundaries. CONCLUSION: Using a well-characterized
	pair of DNA samples, close to 200 CNVs were identified, of which
	nearly 50\% appear novel yet were independently validated using quantitative
	PCR. The results indicate that non-polymorphic probes provide a robust
	approach for CNV identification, and the increasing precision of
	CNV boundary delineation should allow a more complete analysis of
	their genomic organization.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microarray-based measurement of mRNA abundance assumes
	a linear relationship between the fluorescence intensity and the
	dye concentration. In reality, however, the calibration curve can
	be nonlinear. RESULTS: By scanning a microarray scanner calibration
	slide containing known concentrations of fluorescent dyes under 18
	PMT gains, we were able to evaluate the differences in calibration
	characteristics of Cy5 and Cy3. First, the calibration curve for
	the same dye under the same PMT gain is nonlinear at both the high
	and low intensity ends. Second, the degree of nonlinearity of the
	calibration curve depends on the PMT gain. Third, the two PMTs (for
	Cy5 and Cy3) behave differently even under the same gain. Fourth,
	the background intensity for the Cy3 channel is higher than that
	for the Cy5 channel. The impact of such characteristics on the accuracy
	and reproducibility of measured mRNA abundance and the calculated
	ratios was demonstrated. Combined with simulation results, we provided
	explanations to the existence of ratio underestimation, intensity-dependence
	of ratio bias, and anti-correlation of ratios in dye-swap replicates.
	We further demonstrated that although Lowess normalization effectively
	eliminates the intensity-dependence of ratio bias, the systematic
	deviation from true ratios largely remained. A method of calculating
	ratios based on concentrations estimated from the calibration curves
	was proposed for correcting ratio bias. CONCLUSION: It is preferable
	to scan microarray slides at fixed, optimal gain settings under which
	the linearity between concentration and intensity is maximized. Although
	normalization methods improve reproducibility of microarray measurements,

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The recently discovered adult neural stem cells, which
	maintain continuous generation of new neuronal and glial cells throughout
	adulthood, are a promising and expandable source of cells for use
	in cell replacement therapies within the central nervous system.
	These cells could either be induced to proliferate and differentiate
	endogenously, or expanded and differentiated in culture before being
	transplanted into the damaged site of the brain. In order to achieve
	these goals effective strategies to isolate, expand and differentiate
	neural stem cells into the desired specific phenotypes must be developed.
	However, little is known as yet about the factors and mechanisms
	influencing these processes. It has recently been reported that pituitary
	adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) promotes neural
	stem cell proliferation both in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS: We used
	cDNA microarrays with the aim of analysing the transcriptional changes
	underlying PACAP induced proliferation of neural stem cells. The
	primary neural stem/progenitor cells used were neurospheres, generated
	from the lateral ventricle wall of the adult mouse brain. The results
	were compared to both differentiation and proliferation controls,
	which revealed an unexpected and significant differential expression
	relating to withdrawal of epidermal growth factor (EGF) from the
	neurosphere growth medium. The effect of EGF removal was so pronounced
	that it masked the changes in gene expression patterns produced by
	the addition of PACAP. CONCLUSION: Experimental models aiming at
	transcriptional analysis of induced proliferation in primary neural
	stem cells need to take into consideration the significant effect
	on transcription caused by removal of EGF. Alternatively, EGF-free

	of neurospheres originating from separate isolations of the lateral
	ventricle wall of adult mice and passaged to varying degrees. Separate

  abstract = {Background correction is an important preprocessing step for microarray
	data that attempts to adjust the data for the ambient intensity surrounding
	each feature. The "normexp" method models the observed pixel intensities
	as the sum of 2 random variables, one normally distributed and the
	other exponentially distributed, representing background noise and
	signal, respectively. Using a saddle-point approximation, Ritchie
	and others (2007) found normexp to be the best background correction
	method for 2-color microarray data. This article develops the normexp
	method further by improving the estimation of the parameters. A complete
	mathematical development is given of the normexp model and the associated
	saddle-point approximation. Some subtle numerical programming issues
	are solved which caused the original normexp method to fail occasionally
	when applied to unusual data sets. A practical and reliable algorithm
	is developed for exact maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) using
	high-quality optimization software and using the saddle-point estimates
	as starting values. "MLE" is shown to outperform heuristic estimators
	proposed by other authors, both in terms of estimation accuracy and
	in terms of performance on real data. The saddle-point approximation
	is an adequate replacement in most practical situations. The performance
	of normexp for assessing differential expression is improved by adding
	a small offset to the corrected intensities.},

	put forward to explain these data. It was shown that the Langmuir

	to concentration. However, this model fails to explain some key properties
	of the observed signal. In particular, according to the simple Langmuir
	isotherm, all probes should saturate at the same intensity level.
	However, this effect was not observed in the publicly available Affymetrix

	intensities vary greatly and can be predicted based on the probe
	sequence composition. In our experimental study, we attempt to account
	for the unexplained variation in the observed probe intensities using
	customized fluidics scripts. We explore experimentally the effect

	on the final microarray signal. The washing effect is assessed by
	scanning chips both prior to and after the stringent wash. Selective
	labeling of both specific and non-specific targets allows the visualization

	have developed a high-throughput approach for assessment of DNA copy-number

	of sizes (1.3-145.9 Mb), identified chromosomes containing anonymous
	chromatin, and used genotype data to determine the molecular origin
	of two cases of UPD. Furthermore, our data provided independent confirmation
	for a case that had been misinterpreted by karyotype analysis. The
	high resolution of our approach provides more-precise breakpoint
	mapping, which allows subtle phenotypic heterogeneity to be distinguished
	at a molecular level. The accurate genotype information provided

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To describe gene expression differences between healthy,
	young human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells from the macular
	area and RPE cells from two locations in the retinal periphery. METHODS:
	RPE cells from six human donor eyes, ages 17-36, without histopathological
	abnormalities, were dissected by laser and isolated from cryosections.
	Total RNA was isolated, amplified, and hybridized to a custom made
	oligonucleotide array containing 22,000 genes. Bioinformatic analysis
	was carried out using the computer programs Rosetta Resolver and
	the webtools EASE/David and GoStat. Confirmatory real time PCR (RT-PCR)
	and immunohistochemistry were performed according to standard protocols.
	RESULTS: Microarray and statistical analysis yielded 438 genes that
	were differentially expressed between macular RPE, and at least one
	out of two peripheral RPE locations. Out of these genes, 33 that
	showed fold changes of four, or higher, were selected for RT-PCR
	confirmation. For 17 genes (51\%), a significant differential expression
	was found, while 11 additional genes (33\%) showed a similar trend.
	Immuno-staining of one target (WFDC1) confirmed its differential
	expression on the protein level. Functional annotation and overrepresentation
	analysis independently defined extracellular matrix (ECM) genes as
	a statistically overrepresented class of genes in our RPE dataset.
	In total, 33 ECM genes were differentially expressed between macular
	and peripheral RPE regions. A subset of proteins corresponding to
	these genes is known to be present in Bruch's membrane. CONCLUSIONS:
	Our data showed that consistent topographical gene expression differences
	in the human RPE constitute around 1-5\% of the RPE transcriptome.
	These changes may underlie topographical differences in RPE physiology,
	and pathology and may reflect local differences in the molecular
	composition and turnover of Bruch's membrane.},

	mutations) are widely believed to be sufficient for tumorigenesis.
	However, mutant allele specific imbalance (MASI) has been observed
	in tumors and cell lines harboring mutations of oncogenes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL
	FINDINGS: We determined 1) mutational status, 2) copy number gains
	(CNGs) and 3) relative ratio between mutant and wild type alleles
	of KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA and EGFR genes by direct sequencing and quantitative
	PCR assay in over 400 human tumors, cell lines, and xenografts of
	lung, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers. Examination of a public
	database indicated that homozygous mutations of five oncogenes were
	frequent (20\%) in 833 cell lines of 12 tumor types. Our data indicated
	two major forms of MASI: 1) MASI with CNG, either complete or partial;
	and 2) MASI without CNG (uniparental disomy; UPD), due to complete
	loss of wild type allele. MASI was a frequent event in mutant EGFR
	(75\%) and was due mainly to CNGs, while MASI, also frequent in mutant
	KRAS (58\%), was mainly due to UPD. Mutant: wild type allelic ratios
	at the genomic level were precisely maintained after transcription.
	KRAS mutations or CNGs were significantly associated with increased
	ras GTPase activity, as measured by ELISA, and the two molecular
	changes were synergistic. Of 237 lung adenocarcinoma tumors, the
	small number with both KRAS mutation and CNG were associated with
	shortened survival. CONCLUSIONS: MASI is frequently present in mutant
	EGFR and KRAS tumor cells, and is associated with increased mutant
	allele transcription and gene activity. The frequent finding of mutations,
	CNGs and MASI occurring together in tumor cells indicates that these
	three genetic alterations, acting together, may have a greater role
	in the development or maintenance of the malignant phenotype than
	any individual alteration.},

	classification under feature variability.},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2009},
  volume = {10},
  pages = {389},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Large discrepancies in signature composition and outcome
	concordance have been observed between different microarray breast
	cancer expression profiling studies. This is often ascribed to differences
	in array platform as well as biological variability. We conjecture
	that other reasons for the observed discrepancies are the measurement
	error associated with each feature and the choice of preprocessing
	method. Microarray data are known to be subject to technical variation
	and the confidence intervals around individual point estimates of
	expression levels can be wide. Furthermore, the estimated expression
	values also vary depending on the selected preprocessing scheme.
	In microarray breast cancer classification studies, however, these
	two forms of feature variability are almost always ignored and hence
	their exact role is unclear. RESULTS: We have performed a comprehensive
	sensitivity analysis of microarray breast cancer classification under
	the two types of feature variability mentioned above. We used data
	from six state of the art preprocessing methods, using a compendium
	consisting of eight different datasets, involving 1131 hybridizations,
	containing data from both one and two-color array technology. For
	a wide range of classifiers, we performed a joint study on performance,
	concordance and stability. In the stability analysis we explicitly
	tested classifiers for their noise tolerance by using perturbed expression
	profiles that are based on uncertainty information directly related
	to the preprocessing methods. Our results indicate that signature
	composition is strongly influenced by feature variability, even if
	the array platform and the stratification of patient samples are
	identical. In addition, we show that there is often a high level
	of discordance between individual class assignments for signatures
	constructed on data coming from different preprocessing schemes,
	even if the actual signature composition is identical. CONCLUSION:
	Feature variability can have a strong impact on breast cancer signature
	composition, as well as the classification of individual patient
	samples. We therefore strongly recommend that feature variability
	is considered in analyzing data from microarray breast cancer expression
	profiling experiments.},

  abstract = {A Mycobacterium high-density DNA probe array designed to detect rpoB
	mutations conferring rifampicin resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis
	was evaluated. The rpoB hybridisation patterns produced by 41 susceptible
	(RifS) and 59 rifampicin-resistant (RifR) clinical isolates of M.
	tuberculosis were compared with the results of conventional dideoxynucleotide
	sequencing of the rpoB gene. For all the RifR isolates, the rpoB
	hybridisation patterns correlated with the rpoB sequencing results.
	Among the 59 isolates, 11 distinct amino-acid changes were detected
	by the DNA probe array. Of these, 36 (61\%) corresponded to replacement
	of the serine residue found in position 531 (S531L in 34 isolates
	and S531W in two isolates), 16 (27\%) affected histidine 526 (five
	H526D, five H526Y, four H526L, one H526N and one H526R), four (6.8\%)
	replaced aspartate 516 with a valine, and one (1.7\%) replaced glutamine
	513 with a leucine. Deletion of the asparagine residue at position
	519 was detected in one isolate susceptible to rifampicin, but yielding
	c. 0.1\% resistant colonies on rifampicin-containing medium. No mutation
	was detected in the rpoB region from one isolate yielding c. 5\%
	of resistant colonies on rifampicin-containing medium. Finally, a
	D516Y substitution was detected in association with an unexpected
	mutation, G523W, not tiled on the DNA probe array, but which could
	be detected by analysing the hybridisation pattern obtained with
	the wild-type probes covering codon 523. In conclusion, the Mycobacterium
	probe array is a promising approach to rapid detection of mutations
	involved in rifampicin resistance in M. tuberculosis.},

	apoptosis are the primary causes of cell-to-cell variability in the
	timing and probability of death in human cell lines. Protein state
	is transmitted from mother to daughter, giving rise to transient

	so that sister cells soon become no more similar to each other than

  abstract = {Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) is a heterogeneous disorder associated
	with intrauterine and postnatal growth restriction, body asymmetry,
	a relative macrocephaly, a characteristic triangular face and further
	dysmorphisms. In about 50\% of patients genetic/epigenetic alterations
	can be detected: >38\% of patients show a hypomethylation of the
	IGF2/H19 imprinting region in 11p15, additional 10\% carry a maternal
	uniparental disomy of chromosome 7. In single cases, cytogenetic
	aberrations can be detected. Nevertheless, there still remain 50\%
	of SRS patients without known genetic/epigenetic alterations. To
	find out whether submicroscopic imbalances contribute to the aetiology
	of SRS we screened 20 idiopathic SRS patients with the Affymetrix
	GeneChip(R) Human Mapping 500 K array set. Apart from known apathogenic
	copy number variations (CNVs) we identified one patient with a 12q14
	microdeletion. The 12q14 microdeletion syndrome is characterised
	by dwarfism but it additionally includes mental retardation and osteopoikilosis.
	The deletion in our patient is smaller than those in the 12q14 microdeletion
	carriers but it also affects the LEMD3 and the HMGA2 genes. LEMD3
	haploinsufficiency and point mutations have been previously associated
	with osteopoikilosis but radiographs of our patient at the age of
	16 years did not reveal any hint for osteopoikilosis lesions. Haploinsufficiency
	of HMGA2 is probably responsible for aberrant growth in 12q14 microdeletion
	syndrome. However, we excluded a general role of HMGA2 mutations
	for SRS by sequencing of 20 idiopathic patients. In conclusion, our
	results exclude a common cryptic chromosomal imbalance in idiopathic
	SRS patients but show that chromosomal aberrations are relevant in
	this disease. Thus molecular karyotyping is indicated in SRS and

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Illumina Infinium whole genome genotyping (WGG) arrays
	are increasingly being applied in cancer genomics to study gene copy
	number alterations and allele-specific aberrations such as loss-of-heterozygosity
	(LOH). Methods developed for normalization of WGG arrays have mostly
	focused on diploid, normal samples. However, for cancer samples genomic
	aberrations may confound normalization and data interpretation. Therefore,
	we examined the effects of the conventionally used normalization
	method for Illumina Infinium arrays when applied to cancer samples.
	RESULTS: We demonstrate an asymmetry in the detection of the two
	alleles for each SNP, which deleteriously influences both allelic
	proportions and copy number estimates. The asymmetry is caused by
	a remaining bias between the two dyes used in the Infinium II assay
	after using the normalization method in Illumina's proprietary software
	(BeadStudio). We propose a quantile normalization strategy for correction
	of this dye bias. We tested the normalization strategy using 535
	individual hybridizations from 10 data sets from the analysis of
	cancer genomes and normal blood samples generated on Illumina Infinium
	II 300 k version 1 and 2, 370 k and 550 k BeadChips. We show that
	the proposed normalization strategy successfully removes asymmetry
	in estimates of both allelic proportions and copy numbers. Additionally,
	the normalization strategy reduces the technical variation for copy
	number estimates while retaining the response to copy number alterations.
	CONCLUSION: The proposed normalization strategy represents a valuable
	tool that improves the quality of data obtained from Illumina Infinium
	arrays, in particular when used for LOH and copy number variation
	studies.},

	Later, a SARS resequencing GeneChip was developed by Affymetrix to
	characterize the complete genome of SARS-CoV on a single GeneChip.
	The present study was carried out to evaluate the performance of
	SARS resequencing GeneChips. Two human SARS-CoV strains (CDC#200301157
	and Urbani) were resequenced by the SARS GeneChips. Five overlapping
	PCR amplicons were generated for each strain and hybridized with
	these GeneChips. The successfully hybridized GeneChips generated
	nucleotide sequences of nearly complete genomes for the two SARS-CoV
	strains with an average call rate of 94.6\%. Multiple alignments
	of nucleotide sequences obtained from SARS GeneChips and conventional
	sequencing revealed full concordance. Furthermore, the GeneChip-based
	analysis revealed no additional polymorphic sites. The results of
	this study suggest that GeneChip-based genome characterization is
	fast and reproducible. Thus, SARS resequencing GeneChips may be employed
	as an alternate tool to obtain genome sequences of SARS-CoV strains
	pathogenic for humans in order to further understand the transmission

	the degrees of freedom concept. Random errors from a known distribution
	are added to a known model, for example, $y(x) = \alpha + \beta x$,
	and the least squares fit to the model + error data is computed.
	The least squares fit produces a new model, $y(x) = a + bx$. By definition
	the sum of squared deviations between the least squares fit model
	and the data is always less than the sum of squared deviations between
	the original model and the data. When this process is repeated thousands
	of times on the computer, using different random errors each time,
	a pattern emerges. On average the difference between the two sums
	of squared deviations approaches an integer multiple of the error
	distribution variance. Furthermore, this integer equals the number
	of regression parameters in the model. For instance, this is the
	origin of the two degrees of freedom associated with a linear model.
	Using the computer it is easy to verify this property for regression
	models with more than two parameters and for different error distributions.
	The previous degree of freedom property depends only on the variance
	of the error distribution and use of the least squares method; it
	does not depend on the detailed shape of the distribution. However,
	when the normal error distribution with mean = 0 and variance = 1
	is used, a connection to another use of the degrees of freedom terminology
	is found. For a model with M parameters, the normalized frequency
	distribution of the difference between the two sets of squared deviations
	is calculated, using 2,000 computer trials, and shown to match the
	chi-square distribution with M degrees of freedom.},

	and inheritable, CNAs are acquired somatic alterations most often
	observed in tumor tissues only. CNVs tend to be short and more sparsely

	components, genoCNV and genoCNA, designed for CNV and CNA studies,
	respectively. In contrast to most existing methods, genoCN is more
	flexible in that the model parameters are estimated from the data
	instead of being decided a priori. GenoCNA also incorporates two
	important strategies for CNA studies. First, the effects of tissue
	contamination are explicitly modeled. Second, if SNP arrays are performed
	for both tumor and normal tissues of one individual, the genotype
	calls from normal tissue are used to study CNAs in tumor tissue.
	We evaluated genoCN by applications to 162 HapMap individuals and
	a brain tumor (glioblastoma) dataset and showed that our method can

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microscopists are familiar with many blemishes that fluorescence
	images can have due to dust and debris, glass flaws, uneven distribution
	of fluids or surface coatings, etc. Microarray scans show similar
	artefacts, which affect the analysis, particularly when one tries
	to detect subtle changes. However, most blemishes are hard to find
	by the unaided eye, particularly in high-density oligonucleotide
	arrays (HDONAs). RESULTS: We present a method that harnesses the
	statistical power provided by having several HDONAs available, which
	are obtained under similar conditions except for the experimental
	factor. This method "harshlights" blemishes and renders them evident.
	We find empirically that about 25\% of our chips are blemished, and
	we analyze the impact of masking them on screening for differentially
	expressed genes. CONCLUSION: Experiments attempting to assess subtle
	expression changes should be carefully screened for blemishes on
	the chips. The proposed method provides investigators with a novel
	robust approach to improve the sensitivity of microarray analyses.
	By utilizing topological information to identify and mask blemishes
	prior to model based analyses, the method prevents artefacts from

	Although several putative target genes have been linked to the beta-cell
	function of Ipf1/Pdx1, relatively little is known with respect to
	genes regulated by IPF1/PDX1 in early pancreatic progenitor cells.
	RESULTS: Microarray analyses identified a total of 111 genes that
	were differentially expressed in e10.5 pancreatic buds of Ipf1/Pdx1-/-
	embryos. The expression of one of these, Spondin 1, which encodes
	an extracellular matrix protein, has not previously been described

	with phenotypic analysis of alcohol consumption, to identify candidate
	genes that predispose to varying levels of alcohol intake by HXB/BXH
	recombinant inbred rat strains. In addition, in two populations of
	humans, we assessed genetic polymorphisms associated with alcohol
	consumption using a custom genotyping array for 1,350 single nucleotide
	polymorphisms (SNPs). Our goal was to ascertain whether our approach,
	which relies on statistical and informatics techniques, and non-human
	animal models of alcohol drinking behavior, could inform interpretation
	of genetic association studies with human populations. RESULTS: In
	the HXB/BXH recombinant inbred (RI) rats, correlation analysis of
	brain gene expression levels with alcohol consumption in a two-bottle
	choice paradigm, and filtering based on behavioral and gene expression
	quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses, generated a list of candidate
	genes. A literature-based, functional analysis of the interactions
	of the products of these candidate genes defined pathways linked
	to presynaptic GABA release, activation of dopamine neurons, and
	postsynaptic GABA receptor trafficking, in brain regions including
	the hypothalamus, ventral tegmentum and amygdala. The analysis also
	implicated energy metabolism and caloric intake control as potential
	influences on alcohol consumption by the recombinant inbred rats.
	In the human populations, polymorphisms in genes associated with
	GABA synthesis and GABA receptors, as well as genes related to dopaminergic
	transmission, were associated with alcohol consumption. CONCLUSION:
	Our results emphasize the importance of the signaling pathways identified
	using the non-human animal models, rather than single gene products,
	in identifying factors responsible for complex traits such as alcohol
	consumption. The results suggest cross-species similarities in pathways
	that influence predisposition to consume alcohol by rats and humans.
	The importance of a well-defined phenotype is also illustrated. Our
	results also suggest that different genetic factors predispose alcohol

	data. A number of such calling algorithms have been recently established
	for the Affymetrix GeneChip genotyping technology. Here, we present
	a fast and accurate genotype calling algorithm for the Illumina BeadArray
	genotyping platforms. As the technology moves towards assaying millions
	of genetic polymorphisms simultaneously, there is a need for an integrated
	and easy-to-use software for calling genotypes. RESULTS: We have
	introduced a model-based genotype calling algorithm which does not
	rely on having prior training data or require computationally intensive
	procedures. The algorithm can assign genotypes to hybridization data
	from thousands of individuals simultaneously and pools information
	across multiple individuals to improve the calling. The method can
	accommodate variations in hybridization intensities which result
	in dramatic shifts of the position of the genotype clouds by identifying
	the optimal coordinates to initialize the algorithm. By incorporating
	the process of perturbation analysis, we can obtain a quality metric
	measuring the stability of the assigned genotype calls. We show that
	this quality metric can be used to identify SNPs with low call rates
	and accuracy. AVAILABILITY: The C++ executable for the algorithm

  title = {{An Adenocarcinoma Case Study of the BaFL Protocol: Biological Probe
	Filtering for Robust Microarray Analysis}},
  school = {George Mason University},
  year = {2008},
  month = {Feb},
  abstract = {Microarrays are high throughput data measurement technologies; those
	that assay gene expression levels allowing investigators to simultaneously
	estimate the level of thousands of cellular transcripts present in
	a sample at the time of collection. Many sources of variation have
	plagued Microarray analysis, leading to apparent inconsistencies
	between experimental results derived from independent platforms.
	A rigorous, robust set of methods for identifying all of the currently
	known sources of variability and consistently applying them across
	large data sets has been implemented in the Biologically applied
	Filter Level, BaFL, protocol. This protocol eliminates all probes
	for which the underlying sequence characteristics are missing, because
	of which the probe characteristics, including the identification
	of the measured transcript region, are impossible to derive. The
	remaining probes are processed through the biophysical software to
	determine their Gibb’s free energy, as a measure of the solution
	stability. This measure eliminates any overly stable probes, which
	would be less assessable to measure the desired transcript region.
	The filtering process also enforces a range of acceptable signal
	intensity measurements, the result of scanner characteristics. Measurements
	outside the linear range violate the linear correlation relationship
	between transcript concentration and signal intensity. Probes identified
	as covering single nucleotide polymorphisms are identified and removed.
	The Ensembl database is queried to identify probes which measure
	single specific gene transcript regions, all other probes were excluded.
	The final step is to enforce a rule that a minimum of four probes
	are retained, so that any given statistical estimator of concentration
	has an adequate basis. Samples are subject to many technical steps,
	so tests for outliers are implemented that included comparisons of
	representative probe intensities and probe numbers, against the population
	mean. Samples exceeding ±2 standard deviations of the average probe
	numbers and probe intensities are removed. ProbeSet constituents
	at this stage may not be identical across all samples, with differences
	arising from the linear range filter step. By performing an intersection
	operation of the remaining probes across all samples, still enforcing
	a minimum of four probes per ProbeSet, a final, common ProbeSet dataset
	is derived, which is used as the basis of all further comparisons
	and analyses. The suggested data models demonstrated improved performance
	across three classification algorithms, and remarkable latent structure
	can be seen across the data models. When Bonferonni correction is
	applied and the intersecting genes identified a final candidate gene
	list of 30 ProbeSets results. By including on/off genes in the list,
	an additional ProbeSet is identified. These 31 candidate genes demonstrate
	notable connectivity in their GO and KEGG associations. Literature
	review of the genes establishes that these associations arise from
	properties specific to angiogenesis and tumorogenesis. A multiclass
	dataset of non small cell lung cancer samples was constructed and
	information gain calculated from the k-means clustering efficiency.
	A candidate list of 18 genes is shown to possess an information gain
	greater than or equal to 0.8. The literature review of these 18 genes
	provides evidence that abnormal cytokinesis may underlie tumorogenesis
	for both cancer sub-types. The squamous cell carcinomas, in particular,
	appear to suffering from the production of radical oxidative species.
	Currently most Microarray analyses implement one of a small number
	of published probe cleansing algorithms. Occasional efforts to accommodate
	one of the confounding factors of the probe-transcript interaction
	have been made, but no method is as inclusive as that presented in
	this work. Further, no work exists that demonstrates the improved
	efficacy of removing a factor on subsequent performance with the
	existing algorithms. Great effort has been taken here to show that
	analysis of the resulting datasets leads to greatly improved consistency
	in inter-experimental comparisons, using two independent lung adenocarcinoma
	datasets, in comparison to the pre-eminent probe cleansing methodologies,
	RMA and dCHIP.},

  year = {2009},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microarrays depend on appropriate probe design to deliver
	the promise of accurate genome-wide measurement. Probe design, ideally,
	produces a unique probe-target match with homogeneous duplex stability
	over the complete set of probes. Much of microarray pre-processing
	is concerned with adjusting for non-ideal probes that do not report
	target concentration accurately. Cross-hybridizing probes (non-unique),
	probe composition and structure, as well as platform effects such
	as instrument limitations, have been shown to affect the interpretation
	of signal. Data cleansing pipelines seldom filter specifically for
	these constraints, relying instead on general statistical tests to
	remove the most variable probes from the samples in a study. This
	adjusts probes contributing to ProbeSet (gene) values in a study-specific
	manner. We refer to the complete set of factors as biologically applied
	filter levels (BaFL) and have assembled an analysis pipeline for
	managing them consistently. The pipeline and associated experiments
	reported here examine the outcome of comprehensively excluding probes
	affected by known factors on inter-experiment target behavior consistency.
	RESULTS: We present here a 'white box' probe filtering and intensity
	transformation protocol that incorporates currently understood factors
	affecting probe and target interactions; the method has been tested
	on data from the Affymetrix human GeneChip HG-U95Av2, using two independent
	datasets from studies of a complex lung adenocarcinoma phenotype.
	The protocol incorporates probe-specific effects from SNPs, cross-hybridization
	and low heteroduplex affinity, as well as effects from scanner sensitivity,
	sample batches, and includes simple statistical tests for identifying
	unresolved biological factors leading to sample variability. Subsequent
	to filtering for these factors, the consistency and reliability of
	the remaining measurements is shown to be markedly improved. CONCLUSIONS:
	The data cleansing protocol yields reproducible estimates of a given
	probe or ProbeSet's (gene's) relative expression that translates
	across datasets, allowing for credible cross-experiment comparisons.
	We provide supporting evidence for the validity of removing several
	large classes of probes, and for our approaches for removing outlying
	samples. The resulting expression profiles demonstrate consistency
	across the two independent datasets. Finally, we demonstrate that,
	given an appropriate sampling pool, the method enhances the t-test's
	statistical power to discriminate significantly different means over
	sample classes.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: A variety of diseases are caused by chromosomal
	abnormalities such as aneuploidies (having an abnormal number of
	chromosomes), microdeletions, microduplications, and uniparental
	disomy. High density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays
	provide information on chromosomal copy number changes, as well as
	genotype (heterozygosity and homozygosity). SNP array studies generate
	multiple types of data for each SNP site, some with more than 100,000
	SNPs represented on each array. The identification of different classes
	of anomalies within SNP data has been challenging. RESULTS: We have
	developed SNPscan, a web-accessible tool to analyze and visualize
	high density SNP data. It enables researchers (1) to visually and
	quantitatively assess the quality of user-generated SNP data relative
	to a benchmark data set derived from a control population, (2) to
	display SNP intensity and allelic call data in order to detect chromosomal
	copy number anomalies (duplications and deletions), (3) to display
	uniparental isodisomy based on loss of heterozygosity (LOH) across
	genomic regions, (4) to compare paired samples (e.g. tumor and normal),
	and (5) to generate a file type for viewing SNP data in the University
	of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) Human Genome Browser. SNPscan accepts
	data exported from Affymetrix Copy Number Analysis Tool as its input.
	We validated SNPscan using data generated from patients with known
	deletions, duplications, and uniparental disomy. We also inspected
	previously generated SNP data from 90 apparently normal individuals
	from the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) collection,
	and identified three cases of uniparental isodisomy, four females
	having an apparently mosaic X chromosome, two mislabelled SNP data
	sets, and one microdeletion on chromosome 2 with mosaicism from an
	apparently normal female. These previously unrecognized abnormalities
	were all detected using SNPscan. The microdeletion was independently
	confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and a region of
	homozygosity in a UPD case was confirmed by sequencing of genomic
	DNA. CONCLUSIONS: SNPscan is useful to identify chromosomal abnormalities
	based on SNP intensity (such as chromosomal copy number changes)
	and heterozygosity data (including regions of LOH and some cases
	of UPD). The program and source code are available at the SNPscan

  abstract = {Aberrant expression of the platelet-derived growth factor alpha-receptor
	(PDGFRA) gene has been associated with various diseases, including
	neural tube defects and gliomas. We have previously identified 5
	distinct haplotypes for the PDGFRA promoter region, designated H1,
	H2alpha, H2beta, H2gamma and H2delta. Of these haplotypes H1 and
	H2alpha are the most common, whereby H1 drives low and H2alpha high
	transcriptional activity in transient transfection assays. Here we
	have investigated the role of these PDGFRA promoter haplotypes in
	gliomagenesis at both the genetic and cellular level. In a case-control
	study on 71 glioblastoma patients, we observed a clear underrepresentation
	of H1 alleles, with pH1 = 0.141 in patients and pH1 = 0.211 in a
	combined Western European control group (n = 998, p < 0.05). Furthermore,
	in 3 out of 4 available H1/H2alpha heterozygous human glioblastoma
	cell lines, H1-derived mRNA levels were more than 10-fold lower than
	from H2alpha, resulting at least in part from haplotype-specific
	epigenetic differences such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation.
	Together, these results indicate that PDGFRA promoter haplotypes
	may predispose to gliomas. We propose a model in which PDGFRA is
	upregulated in a haplotype-specific manner during neural stem cell
	differentiation, which affects the pool size of cells that can later
	undergo gliomagenesis.},

	be posed as problems of learning low dimensional linear or multi-linear
	models. These models have been widely used for the representation
	of shape, appearance, motion, etc., in computer vision applications.
	Methods for learning linear models can be seen as a special case
	of subspace fitting. One draw-back of previous learning methods is
	that they are based on least squares estimation techniques and hence
	fail to account for “outliers” which are common in realistic training
	sets. We review previous approaches for making linear learning methods
	robust to outliers and present a new method that uses an intra-sample
	outlier process to account for pixel outliers. We develop the theory
	of Robust Subspace Learning (RSL) for linear models within a continuous
	optimization framework based on robust M-estimation. The framework
	applies to a variety of linear learning problems in computer vision
	including eigen-analysis and structure from motion. Several synthetic
	and natural examples are used to develop and illustrate the theory

	levels of gene expression and to identify novel splice variants of

	relies on known splice junctions and cannot identify novel ones.
	TopHat is an efficient read-mapping algorithm designed to align reads
	from an RNA-Seq experiment to a reference genome without relying
	on known splice sites. RESULTS: We mapped the RNA-Seq reads from
	a recent mammalian RNA-Seq experiment and recovered more than 72\%
	of the splice junctions reported by the annotation-based software
	from that study, along with nearly 20,000 previously unreported junctions.
	The TopHat pipeline is much faster than previous systems, mapping
	nearly 2.2 million reads per CPU hour, which is sufficient to process
	an entire RNA-Seq experiment in less than a day on a standard desktop
	computer. We describe several challenges unique to ab initio splice

	The methodology is general but was initially motivated from cluster
	analysis of microarray experiments. Most current algorithms aim to
	assign all genes into clusters. For many biological studies, however,
	we are mainly interested in identifying the most informative, tight,
	and stable clusters of sizes, say, 20-60 genes for further investigation.
	We want to avoid the contamination of tightly regulated expression
	patterns of biologically relevant genes due to other genes whose
	expressions are only loosely compatible with these patterns. "Tight
	clustering" has been developed specifically to address this problem.
	It applies K-means clustering as an intermediate clustering engine.
	Early truncation of a hierarchical clustering tree is used to overcome
	the local minimum problem in K-means clustering. The tightest and
	most stable clusters are identified in a sequential manner through
	an analysis of the tendency of genes to be grouped together under
	repeated resampling. We validated this method in a simulated example

	such as the Affymetrix HG-U133A GeneChip, use sets of probes chosen
	to match specified genes, with the expectation that if a particular
	gene is highly expressed then all the probes in that gene's probe
	set will provide a consistent message signifying the gene's presence.
	We have tested this expectation by examining the correlations between
	probes using the data on thousands of arrays that are available in
	the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository. {Results:} We
	have identified probes that are not well-correlated with the other
	probes in their probeset but nevertheless are highly correlated with
	probes in other probesets. The common element of these highly correlated
	probes is that they contain a G-spot (a sequence of four or more
	guanines). {Conclusions:} Since these G-spot probes generally show
	little correlation with the other members of their probesets they
	are not fit for purpose and their values should be excluded when
	calculating gene expression values. This has serious implications,
	since more than 40\% of the probesets in the HG-U133A GeneChip contain
	at least one such probe. Future array designs should avoid these
	untrustworthy probes.},

	of DNA copy number for thousands of sites on a genome. We developed
	the circular binary segmentation (CBS) algorithm to divide the genome
	into regions of equal copy number. The algorithm tests for change-points
	using a maximal t-statistic with a permutation reference distribution
	to obtain the corresponding P-value. The number of computations required
	for the maximal test statistic is O(N2), where N is the number of
	markers. This makes the full permutation approach computationally
	prohibitive for the newer arrays that contain tens of thousands markers
	and highlights the need for a faster algorithm. RESULTS: We present
	a hybrid approach to obtain the P-value of the test statistic in
	linear time. We also introduce a rule for stopping early when there
	is strong evidence for the presence of a change. We show through
	simulations that the hybrid approach provides a substantial gain
	in speed with only a negligible loss in accuracy and that the stopping
	rule further increases speed. We also present the analyses of array
	CGH data from breast cancer cell lines to show the impact of the
	new approaches on the analysis of real data. AVAILABILITY: An R version
	of the CBS algorithm has been implemented in the "DNAcopy" package

  abstract = {Obesity has become a major worldwide challenge to public health, owing
	to an interaction between the Western 'obesogenic' environment and
	a strong genetic contribution. Recent extensive genome-wide association
	studies (GWASs) have identified numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms
	associated with obesity, but these loci together account for only
	a small fraction of the known heritable component. Thus, the 'common
	disease, common variant' hypothesis is increasingly coming under
	challenge. Here we report a highly penetrant form of obesity, initially
	observed in 31 subjects who were heterozygous for deletions of at
	least 593 kilobases at 16p11.2 and whose ascertainment included cognitive
	deficits. Nineteen similar deletions were identified from GWAS data
	in 16,053 individuals from eight European cohorts. These deletions
	were absent from healthy non-obese controls and accounted for 0.7\%
	of our morbid obesity cases (body mass index (BMI) >/= 40 kg m(-2)
	or BMI standard deviation score >/= 4; P = 6.4 x 10(-8), odds ratio
	43.0), demonstrating the potential importance in common disease of
	rare variants with strong effects. This highlights a promising strategy
	for identifying missing heritability in obesity and other complex
	traits: cohorts with extreme phenotypes are likely to be enriched
	for rare variants, thereby improving power for their discovery. Subsequent
	analysis of the loci so identified may well reveal additional rare
	variants that further contribute to the missing heritability, as
	recently reported for SIM1 (ref. 3). The most productive approach
	may therefore be to combine the 'power of the extreme' in small,
	well-phenotyped cohorts, with targeted follow-up in case-control
	and population cohorts.},

	binding free energy and then binding affinity, and develop a probe
	intensity composite representation (PICR) model. The PICR model allows
	the estimation of ACs at a given SNP through statistical regression.
	Furthermore, we demonstrate with cell-line data of known true copy
	numbers that the PICR model can achieve reasonable accuracy in copy
	number estimation at a single SNP locus, by using the ratio of the
	estimated AC of each sample to that of the reference sample, and
	can reveal subtle genotype structure of SNPs at abnormal loci. We
	also demonstrate with HapMap data that the PICR model yields accurate
	SNP genotype calls consistently across samples, laboratories and

	The present study attempted to correlate genomic alterations (loss
	of heterozygosity; LOH) with subclasses of breast cancers having
	distinct gene expression signatures. Hierarchical clustering of expression
	array data from 89 invasive breast cancers identified four major
	expression subclasses. Thirty-four of these cases representative
	of the four subclasses were microdissected and allelotyped using
	genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism detection arrays (Affymetrix,
	Inc.). LOH was determined by comparing tumor and normal single nucleotide
	polymorphism allelotypes. A newly developed statistical tool was
	used to determine the chromosomal regions of frequent LOH. We found
	that breast cancers were highly heterogeneous, with the proportion
	of LOH ranging widely from 0.3\% to >60\% of heterozygous markers.
	The most common sites of LOH were on 17p, 17q, 16q, 11q, and 14q,
	sites reported in previous LOH studies. Signature LOH events were
	discovered in certain expression subclasses. Unique regions of LOH
	on 5q and 4p marked a subclass of breast cancers with "basal-like"
	expression profiles, distinct from other subclasses. LOH on 1p and
	16q occurred preferentially in a subclass of estrogen receptor-positive
	breast cancers. Finding unique LOH patterns in different groups of
	breast cancer, in part defined by expression signatures, adds confidence
	to newer schemes of molecular classification. Furthermore, exclusive
	association between biological subclasses and restricted LOH events
	provides rationale to search for targeted genes.},

	The prospect of targeted therapies and the development of high-resolution,
	genome-wide approaches are now spurring systematic efforts to characterize
	cancer genomes. Here we report a large-scale project to characterize
	copy-number alterations in primary lung adenocarcinomas. By analysis
	of a large collection of tumours (n = 371) using dense single nucleotide
	polymorphism arrays, we identify a total of 57 significantly recurrent
	events. We find that 26 of 39 autosomal chromosome arms show consistent
	large-scale copy-number gain or loss, of which only a handful have
	been linked to a specific gene. We also identify 31 recurrent focal
	events, including 24 amplifications and 7 homozygous deletions. Only
	six of these focal events are currently associated with known mutations
	in lung carcinomas. The most common event, amplification of chromosome
	14q13.3, is found in approximately 12\% of samples. On the basis
	of genomic and functional analyses, we identify NKX2-1 (NK2 homeobox
	1, also called TITF1), which lies in the minimal 14q13.3 amplification
	interval and encodes a lineage-specific transcription factor, as
	a novel candidate proto-oncogene involved in a significant fraction
	of lung adenocarcinomas. More generally, our results indicate that

	of affected individuals, these deviations can also provide evidence
	for association. Tests of HWE are commonly performed using a simple
	chi2 goodness-of-fit test. We show that this chi2 test can have inflated
	type I error rates, even in relatively large samples (e.g., samples
	of 1,000 individuals that include approximately 100 copies of the
	minor allele). On the basis of previous work, we describe exact tests
	of HWE together with efficient computational methods for their implementation.
	Our methods adequately control type I error in large and small samples
	and are computationally efficient. They have been implemented in
	freely available code that will be useful for quality assessment

	and mapping of copy number of DNA segments. A challenge is to make
	inferences about the copy number structure of the genome. Several

	comparison of various characteristics of these methods exists. Moreover,
	the segmentation results have not been utilized in downstream analyses.
	RESULTS: We describe a comparison of three popular and publicly available
	methods for the analysis of array CGH data and we demonstrate how
	segmentation results may be utilized in the downstream analyses such
	as testing and classification, yielding higher power and prediction
	accuracy. Since the methods operate on individual chromosomes, we
	also propose a novel procedure for merging segments across the genome,
	which results in an interpretable set of copy number levels, and

	into a key molecular tool for the elucidation of gene function and
	gene regulation. Microarray platforms based on either oligonucleotides
	or purified amplification products have been utilised in parallel
	to produce large amounts of data. Irrespective of platform examined,
	the availability of genome sequence or a large number of representative
	expressed sequence tags (ESTs) is, however, a pre-requisite for the
	design and selection of specific and high-quality microarray probes.
	This is of great importance for organisms, such as Arabidopsis thaliana,
	with a high number of duplicated genes, as cross-hybridisation signals
	between evolutionary related genes cannot be distinguished from true
	signals unless the probes are carefully designed to be specific.
	RESULTS: We present an alternative solid-phase purification strategy
	suitable for efficient preparation of short, biotinylated and highly
	specific probes suitable for large-scale expression profiling. Twenty-one
	thousand Arabidopsis thaliana gene sequence tags were amplified and
	subsequently purified using the described technology. The use of
	the arrays is exemplified by analysis of gene expression changes
	caused by a four-hour indole-3-acetic (auxin) treatment. A total
	of 270 genes were identified as differentially expressed (120 up-regulated
	and 150 down-regulated), including several previously known auxin-affected
	genes, but also several previously uncharacterised genes. CONCLUSIONS:
	The described solid-phase procedure can be used to prepare gene sequence
	tag microarrays based on short and specific amplified probes, facilitating
	the analysis of more than 21,000 Arabidopsis transcripts.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microarray data are subject to multiple sources of variation,
	of which biological sources are of interest whereas most others are
	only confounding. Recent work has identified systematic sources of
	variation that are intensity-dependent and non-linear in nature.
	Systematic sources of variation are not limited to the differing
	properties of the cyanine dyes Cy(5) and Cy(3) as observed in cDNA
	arrays, but are the general case for both oligonucleotide microarray
	(Affymetrix GeneChips) and cDNA microarray data. Current normalization
	techniques are most often linear and therefore not capable of fully
	correcting for these effects. RESULTS: We present here a simple and
	robust non-linear method for normalization using array signal distribution
	analysis and cubic splines. These methods compared favorably to normalization
	using robust local-linear regression (lowess). The application of
	these methods to oligonucleotide arrays reduced the relative error
	between replicates by 5-10\% compared with a standard global normalization
	method. Application to cDNA arrays showed improvements over the standard
	method and over Cy(3)-Cy(5) normalization based on dye-swap replication.
	In addition, a set of known differentially regulated genes was ranked
	higher by the t-test. In either cDNA or Affymetrix technology, signal-dependent
	bias was more than ten times greater than the observed print-tip
	or spatial effects. CONCLUSIONS: Intensity-dependent normalization
	is important for both high-density oligonucleotide array and cDNA
	array data. Both the regression and spline-based methods described
	here performed better than existing linear methods when assessed
	on the variability of replicate arrays. Dye-swap normalization was
	less effective at Cy(3)-Cy(5) normalization than either regression
	or spline-based methods alone.},

	microarray data have not been used to assess the performance of individual
	probes to provide feedback to improve future designs. RESULT: In
	this study, we describe a probe performance assessment method based
	on the concordance of the observed signals from probes that share
	common targets. Using this method, we found that probes containing
	multiple guanines in a row (G-stacks) have abnormal binding behavior
	compared with other probes, both in gene expression assays and genotyping
	assays using Affymetrix microarrays. These probes are less likely
	to covary with other probes that interrogate the same genes. Moreover,
	we found that these probes are much more likely to produce outliers
	when fitting the observed signals according to the positional dependent
	nearest neighbor model, which gives reasonable estimates of binding
	affinity for most other probes. These results suggest that probes
	containing G-stacks tend to have increased cross hybridization signals
	and reduced target-specific hybridization signals, presumably due
	to multiplex binding forming G-quartet structures. Our findings are
	expected to be useful in microarray design and data analysis.},

	for the measurement of gene expression on a large scale. Affymetrix
	GeneChip arrays appear to dominate this market. These arrays use
	short oligonucleotides to probe for genes in an RNA sample. Due to
	optical noise, non-specific hybridization, probe-specific effects,
	and measurement error, ad-hoc measures of expression, that summarize
	probe intensities, can lead to imprecise and inaccurate results.
	Various researchers have demonstrated that expression measures based
	on simple statistical models can provide great improvements over
	the ad-hoc procedure offered by Affymetrix. Recently, physical models
	based on molecular hybridization theory, have been proposed as useful
	tools for prediction of, for example, non-specific hybridization.
	These physical models show great potential in terms of improving
	existing expression measures. In this paper we suggest that the system
	producing the measured intensities is too complex to be fully described
	with these relatively simple physical models and we propose empirically
	motivated stochastic models that compliment the above mentioned molecular
	hybridization theory to provide a comprehensive description of the

	complementary and diverse aspects of transcriptional regulation has
	spawned an increased need for new and effective computational approaches
	to analyze and integrate these large scale assays. Here, we propose
	a novel algorithm, based on random forest methodology, to relate
	gene expression (as derived from expression microarrays) to sequence
	features residing in gene promoters (as derived from DNA motif data)
	and transcription factor binding to gene promoters (as derived from
	tiling microarrays). We extend the random forest approach to model
	a multivariate response as represented, for example, by time-course
	gene expression measures. An analysis of the multivariate random
	forest output reveals complex regulatory networks, which consist
	of cohesive, condition-dependent regulatory cliques. Each regulatory
	clique features homogeneous gene expression profiles and common motifs
	or synergistic motif groups. We apply our method to several yeast
	physiological processes: cell cycle, sporulation, and various stress
	conditions. Our technique displays excellent performance with regard
	to identifying known regulatory motifs, including high order interactions.
	In addition, we present evidence of the existence of an alternative
	MCB-binding pathway, which we confirm using data from two independent
	cell cycle studies and two other physioloigical processes. Finally,
	we have uncovered elaborate transcription regulation refinement mechanisms
	involving PAC and mRRPE motifs that govern essential rRNA processing.
	These include intriguing instances of differing motif dosages and
	differing combinatorial motif control that promote regulatory specificity
	in rRNA metabolism under differing physiological processes.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Modern strategies for mapping disease loci require efficient
	genotyping of a large number of known polymorphic sites in the genome.
	The sensitive and high-throughput nature of hybridization-based DNA
	microarray technology provides an ideal platform for such an application
	by interrogating up to hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide
	polymorphisms (SNPs) in a single assay. Similar to the development
	of expression arrays, these genotyping arrays pose many data analytic
	challenges that are often platform specific. Affymetrix SNP arrays,
	e.g. use multiple sets of short oligonucleotide probes for each known
	SNP, and require effective statistical methods to combine these probe
	intensities in order to generate reliable and accurate genotype calls.
	RESULTS: We developed an integrated multi-SNP, multi-array genotype
	calling algorithm for Affymetrix SNP arrays, MAMS, that combines
	single-array multi-SNP (SAMS) and multi-array, single-SNP (MASS)
	calls to improve the accuracy of genotype calls, without the need
	for training data or computation-intensive normalization procedures
	as in other multi-array methods. The algorithm uses resampling techniques
	and model-based clustering to derive single array based genotype
	calls, which are subsequently refined by competitive genotype calls
	based on (MASS) clustering. The resampling scheme caps computation
	for single-array analysis and hence is readily scalable, important
	in view of expanding numbers of SNPs per array. The MASS update is
	designed to improve calls for atypical SNPs, harboring allele-imbalanced
	binding affinities, that are difficult to genotype without information
	from other arrays. Using a publicly available data set of HapMap
	samples from Affymetrix, and independent calls by alternative genotyping
	methods from the HapMap project, we show that our approach performs
	competitively to existing methods. AVAILABILITY: R functions are
	available upon request from the authors.},

  abstract = {Splicing is an important process for regulation of gene expression
	in eukaryotes, and it has important functional links to other steps
	of gene expression. Two examples of these linkages include Ceg1,
	a component of the mRNA capping enzyme, and the chromatin elongation
	factors Spt4-5, both of which have recently been shown to play a
	role in the normal splicing of several genes in the yeast Saccharomyces
	cerevisiae. Using a genomic approach to characterize the roles of
	Spt4-5 in splicing, we used splicing-sensitive DNA microarrays to
	identify specific sets of genes that are mis-spliced in ceg1, spt4,
	and spt5 mutants. In the context of a complex, nested, experimental
	design featuring 22 dye-swap array hybridizations, comprising both
	biological and technical replicates, we applied five appropriate
	statistical models for assessing differential expression between
	wild-type and the mutants. To refine selection of differential expression
	genes, we then used a robust model-synthesizing approach, Differential
	Expression via Distance Synthesis, to integrate all five models.
	The resultant list of differentially expressed genes was then further
	analyzed with regard to select attributes: we found that highly transcribed
	genes with long introns were most sensitive to spt mutations. QPCR
	confirmation of differential expression was established for the limited
	number of genes evaluated. In this paper, we showcase splicing array
	technology, as well as powerful, yet general, statistical methodology
	for assessing differential expression, in the context of a real,

	complex may help coordinate splicing with transcription under conditions

	sensitive detection of LOH is enabled with accurate determination

	LOH, or uniparental disomy (UPD), in a large number of acute leukemia
	samples. We next applied this technique to detection of UPD involving
	the 9p arm in myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs), which is tightly
	associated with a homozygous JAK2 mutation. It revealed an unexpectedly
	high frequency of 9p UPD that otherwise would have been undetected
	and also disclosed the existence of multiple subpopulations having
	distinct 9p UPD within the same MPD specimen. In conclusion, AsCNAR
	should substantially improve our ability to dissect the complexity

	the monitoring of expression levels for thousands of genes simultaneously.
	Image analysis is an important aspect of microarray experiments,

	genes. This article reviews a number of existing image analysis approaches
	for cDNA microarray experiments and proposes new addressing, segmentation,
	and background correction methods for extracting information from
	microarray scanned images. The segmentation component uses a seeded
	region growing algorithm which makes provision for spots of different
	shapes and sizes. The background estimation approach is based on
	an image analysis technique known as morphological opening. These
	new image analysis procedures are implemented in a software package
	named Spot, built on the R environment for statistical computing.
	The statistical properties of the different segmentation and background
	adjustment methods are examined using microarray data from a study
	of lipid metabolism in mice. It is shown that in some cases background
	adjustment can substantially reduce the precision—that is, increase
	the variability—of low-intensity spot values. In contrast, the choice
	of segmentation procedure has a smaller impact. The comparison further
	suggests that seeded region growing segmentation with morphological

	Microarray Experiment) guidelines and an emphasis on ensuring public-availability
	to all datasets. However, despite its current widespread use and
	availability, very little is known about the extent to which application
	of the different technologies influences the outcome of transcriptional
	profiles and differential expression. The results among the handful
	of published studies are conflicting. Here, we present a comprehensive
	evaluation encompassing different reporter systems (short oligonucleotides,
	long oligonucleotides and cDNAs), labelling techniques and hybridization
	protocols. We used four oligonucleotide and two cDNA platforms to
	compare gene expression between two sample types. We determined the
	overall consistency (reproducibility) within each platform, and correlation
	among replicates within and between technologies. We find that the
	top performing platforms show low levels of technical variability
	that result in an increased ability to detect differential expression.
	Most importantly, we show the top four platforms are highly correlated
	with biological, rather than technological, differences accounting
	for the majority of variation in the data.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies with single nucleotide
	polymorphisms (SNPs) show great promise to identify genetic determinants
	of complex human traits. In current analyses, genotype calling and
	imputation of missing genotypes are usually considered as two separated
	tasks. The genotypes of SNPs are first determined one at a time from
	allele signal intensities. Then the missing genotypes, i.e., no-calls
	caused by not perfectly separated signal clouds, are imputed based
	on the linkage disequilibrium (LD) between multiple SNPs. Although
	many statistical methods have been developed to improve either genotype
	calling or imputation of missing genotypes, treating the two steps
	independently can lead to loss of genetic information. RESULTS: We
	propose a novel genotype calling framework. In this framework, we
	consider the signal intensities and underlying LD structure of SNPs
	simultaneously by estimating both cluster parameters and haplotype
	frequencies. As a result, our new method outperforms some existing
	algorithms in terms of both call rates and genotyping accuracy. Our
	studies also suggest that jointly analyzing multiple SNPs in LD provides
	more accurate estimation of haplotypes than haplotype reconstruction
	methods that only use called genotypes. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates
	that jointly analyzing signal intensities and LD structure of multiple
	SNPs is a better way to determine genotypes and estimate LD parameters.},

	segments of chromosomes, and comprise an important class of genetic
	variation. Recently, various microarray hybridization-based techniques
	have been developed for high throughput measurement of DNA copy number.
	In many studies, multiple technical platforms or different versions
	of the same platform were used to interrogate the same samples; and
	it became necessary to pool information across these multiple sources
	to derive a consensus molecular profile for each sample. An integrated
	analysis is expected to maximize resolution and accuracy, yet currently
	there is no well formulated statistical method to address the between-platform
	differences in probe coverage, assay methods, sensitivity, and analytical
	complexity. RESULTS: The conventional approach is to apply one of
	the CNV detection (a.k.a. "segmentation") algorithms to search for
	DNA segments of altered signal intensity. The results from multiple
	platforms are combined after segmentation. Here we propose a new
	method, Multi-Platform Circular Binary Segmentation (MPCBS), which
	pools statistical evidence across platforms during segmentation,
	and does not require pre-standardization of different data sources.
	It involves a weighted sum of t-statistics, which arises naturally
	from the generalized log-likelihood ratio of a multi-platform model.
	We show by comparing the integrated analysis of Affymetrix and Illumina
	SNP array data with Agilent and fosmid clone endsequencing results
	on 8 HapMap samples that MPCBS achieves improved spatial resolution,
	detection power, and provides a natural consensus across platforms.
	We also apply the new method to analyze multi-platform data for tumor
	samples. AVAILABILITY: The R package for MPCBS is registered on R-Forge

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: DNA copy number aberration (CNA) is a hallmark of genomic
	abnormality in tumor cells. Recurrent CNA (RCNA) occurs in multiple
	cancer samples across the same chromosomal region and has greater
	implication in tumorigenesis. Current commonly-used methods for RNCA
	identification require CNA calling for individual samples before
	cross-sample analysis. This two-step strategy may result in a heavy
	computational burden as well as a loss of the overall statistical
	power due to segmentation and discretization of individual sample's
	data. We propose a population-based approach for RCNA detection with
	no need of single-sample analysis, which is statistically powerful,
	computationally efficient, and particularly suitable for high-resolution
	and large-population studies. RESULTS: Our approach, Correlation
	Matrix Diagonal Segmentation (CMDS), identifies RCNAs based on a
	between-chromosomal-site correlation analysis. Directly using raw
	intensity ratio data from all samples and adopting a diagonal transformation
	strategy, CMDS substantially reduces computational burden and can
	obtain results very quickly from large datasets. Our simulation indicates
	that the statistical power of CMDS is higher than that of single-sample
	CNA calling based two-step approaches. We applied CMDS to two real
	datasets of lung cancer and brain cancer from Affymetrix and Illumina
	array platforms, respectively, and successfully identified known
	regions of CNA associated with EGFR, KRAS, and other important oncogenes.
	CMDS provides a fast, powerful and easily implemented tool for the
	RCNA analysis of large-scale data from cancer genomes. AVAILABILITY:

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Connectivity mapping is a process to recognize novel pharmacological
	and toxicological properties in small molecules by comparing their
	gene expression signatures with others in a database. A simple and
	robust method for connectivity mapping with increased specificity
	and sensitivity was recently developed, and its utility demonstrated
	using experimentally derived gene signatures. RESULTS: This paper
	introduces sscMap (statistically significant connections' map), a
	Java application designed to undertake connectivity mapping tasks
	using the recently published method. The software is bundled with
	a default collection of reference gene-expression profiles based
	on the publicly available dataset from the Broad Institute Connectivity
	Map 02, which includes data from over 7000 Affymetrix microarrays,
	for over 1000 small-molecule compounds, and 6100 treatment instances
	in 5 human cell lines. In addition, the application allows users
	to add their custom collections of reference profiles and is applicable
	to a wide range of other 'omics technologies. CONCLUSION: The utility
	of sscMap is two fold. First, it serves to make statistically significant
	connections between a user-supplied gene signature and the 6100 core
	reference profiles based on the Broad Institute expanded dataset.
	Second, it allows users to apply the same improved method to custom-built
	reference profiles which can be added to the database for future
	referencing. The software can be freely downloaded from http://purl.oclc.org/NET/sscMap.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interaction of a drug or chemical with a biological system
	can result in a gene-expression profile or signature characteristic
	of the event. Using a suitably robust algorithm these signatures
	can potentially be used to connect molecules with similar pharmacological
	or toxicological properties by gene expression profile. Lamb et al
	first proposed the Connectivity Map [Lamb et al (2006), Science 313,
	1929-1935] to make successful connections among small molecules,
	genes, and diseases using genomic signatures. RESULTS: Here we have
	built on the principles of the Connectivity Map to present a simpler
	and more robust method for the construction of reference gene-expression
	profiles and for the connection scoring scheme, which importantly
	allows the valuation of statistical significance of all the connections
	observed. We tested the new method with two randomly generated gene
	signatures and three experimentally derived gene signatures (for
	HDAC inhibitors, estrogens, and immunosuppressive drugs, respectively).
	Our testing with this method indicates that it achieves a higher
	level of specificity and sensitivity and so advances the original
	method. CONCLUSION: The method presented here not only offers more
	principled statistical procedures for testing connections, but more
	importantly it provides effective safeguard against false connections
	at the same time achieving increased sensitivity. With its robust
	performance, the method has potential use in the drug development
	pipeline for the early recognition of pharmacological and toxicological
	properties in chemicals and new drug candidates, and also more broadly
	in other 'omics sciences.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Dilution design (Mixed tissue RNA) has been utilized by
	some researchers to evaluate and assess the performance of multiple
	microarray platforms. Current microarray data analysis approaches
	assume that the quantified signal intensities are linearly related
	to the expression of the corresponding genes in the sample. However,
	there are sources of nonlinearity in microarray expression measurements.
	Such nonlinearity study in the expressions of the RNA mixtures provides
	a new way to analyze gene expression data, and we argue that the
	nonlinearity can reveal novel information for microarray data analysis.
	Therefore, we proposed a statistical model, called proportion model,
	which is based on the linear regression analysis. To approximately
	quantify the nonlinearity in the dilution design, a new calibration,
	beta ratio (BR) was derived from the proportion model. Furthermore,
	a new adjusted fold change (adj-FC) was proposed to predict the true
	FC without nonlinearity, in particular for large FC. RESULTS: We
	applied our method to one microarray dilution dataset. The experimental
	results indicated that, to some extent, there are global biases comparing
	with the linear assumption for the significant genes. Further analysis
	of those highly expressed genes with significant nonlinearity revealed
	some promising results, e.g. 'poison' effect was discovered for some
	genes in RNA mixtures. The adj-FCs of those genes with 'poison' effect,
	indicate that the nonlinearity can be also caused by the inherent
	feature of the genes besides signal noise and technical variation.
	Moreover, when percentage of overlapping genes (POG) was used as
	a cross-platform consistency measure, adj-FC outperformed simple
	fold change to show that Affymetrix and Illumina platforms are consistent.

  abstract = {Microarrays are an example of the powerful high through-put genomics
	tools that are revolutionizing the measurement of biological systems.
	In this and other technologies, a number of critical steps are required
	to convert the raw measures into the data relied upon by biologists
	and clinicians. These data manipulations, referred to as preprocessing,
	have enormous influence on the quality of the ultimate measurements
	and studies that rely upon them. Many researchers have previously
	demonstrated that the use of modern statistical methodology can substantially
	improve accuracy and precision of gene expression measurements, relative
	to ad-hoc procedures introduced by designers and manufacturers of
	the technology. However, further substantial improvements are possible.
	Microarrays are now being used to measure diverse high genomic endpoints
	including yeast mutant representations, the presence of SNPs, presence
	of deletions/insertions, and protein binding sites by chromatin immunoprecipitation
	(known as ChIP-chip). In each case, the genomic units of measurement
	are relatively short DNA molecules referred to as probes. Without
	appropriate understanding of the bias and variance of these measurements,
	biological inferences based upon probe analysis will be compromised.
	Standard operating procedure for microarray researchers is to use
	preprocessed data as the starting point for the statistical analyses
	that produce reported results. This has prevented many researchers
	from carefully considering their choice of preprocessing methodology.
	Furthermore, the fact that the preprocessing step greatly affects
	the stochastic properties of the final statistical summaries is ignored.
	In this paper we propose a statistical framework that permits the
	integration of preprocessing into the standard statistical analysis
	flow of microarray data. We demonstrate its usefulness by applying
	the idea in three different applications of the technology.},

	Usually, a necessary step in the analysis of experiments using these

	expression index that can then be used for determining differential
	expression, for classification, for clustering, and for other analyses.
	In this paper, we propose a new expression index that is competitive
	with the best existing methods, and superior in many cases. We call
	this expression index method GLA, for GLog Average, since after normalization
	at the probe level, we take the mean generalized logarithm of perfect
	match probes. RESULTS: In this paper, we use Affycomp as the primary
	tool to assess the weaknesses and strengths of GLA. Comparisons are
	made between GLA and most widely used summary methods (RMA, MAS5.0
	and MBEI) in great detail. The substantial reduction in variability
