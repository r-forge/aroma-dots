  title = {A single-array preprocessing method for estimating full-resolution
	raw copy numbers from all {Affymetrix} genotyping arrays including
	{GenomeWideSNP 5 \& 6}},

  abstract = {Motivation:
	
	High-resolution copy-number (CN) analysis have in recent years gained
	much
	
	attention, not only for the purpose of identifying CN aberrations
	associated with a
	
	certain phenotype but also for identifying CN polymorphisms. In order
	for such studies
	
	to be successful and cost effective, the statistical methods have
	to be optimized. We
	
	propose a single-array preprocessing method for estimating full-resolution
	total CNs. It
	
	is applicable to all Affymetrix genotyping arrays, including the recent
	ones that also
	
	contain non-polymorphic probes. A reference signal is only needed
	at the last step
	
	when calculating relative CNs.
	
	
	Results: 
	
	As with our method for earlier generations of arrays, this one controls
	for allelic
	
	crosstalk, probe affinities and PCR fragment-length effects. Additionally,
	it also corrects
	
	for probe-sequence effects and co-hybridization of fragments digested
	by multiple
	
	enzymes that takes place on the latest chips. We compare our method
	with Affymetrix'
	
	CN5 method and the dChip method by assessing how well they differentiate
	between
	
	various CN states at the full resolution and various amounts of smoothing.
	Although
	
	the others use data from all arrays for their preprocessing, we observe
	that CRMA v2
	
	performs as well as or better even if it is a single-array method.
	This shows that it is
	
	possible to do online analysis in large-scale projects where additional
	arrays are
	
	introduced over time.
	
	
	Availability: 
	
	A bounded-memory implementation that can process any number of arrays
	is available
	
	in the open-source R package aroma.affymetrix.},

  abstract = {Accurate and complete measurement of single nucleotide (SNP) and copy
	number (CNV) variants, both common and rare, will be required to
	understand the role of genetic variation in disease. We present Birdsuite,
	a four-stage analytical framework instantiated in software for deriving
	integrated and mutually consistent copy number and SNP genotypes.
	The method sequentially assigns copy number across regions of common
	copy number polymorphisms (CNPs), calls genotypes of SNPs, identifies
	rare CNVs via a hidden Markov model (HMM), and generates an integrated
	sequence and copy number genotype at every locus (for example, including
	genotypes such as A-null, AAB and BBB in addition to AA, AB and BB
	calls). Such genotypes more accurately depict the underlying sequence
	of each individual, reducing the rate of apparent mendelian inconsistencies.
	The Birdsuite software is applied here to data from the Affymetrix
	SNP 6.0 array. Additionally, we describe a method, implemented in
	PLINK, to utilize these combined SNP and CNV genotypes for association
	testing with a phenotype.},

  abstract = {Array-CGH is a powerful tool for the detection of chromosomal aberrations.
	The introduction of high-density SNP genotyping technology to genomic
	profiling, termed SNP-CGH, represents a further advance, since simultaneous
	measurement of both signal intensity variations and changes in allelic
	composition makes it possible to detect both copy number changes
	and copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) events. We demonstrate
	the utility of SNP-CGH with two Infinium whole-genome genotyping
	BeadChips, assaying 109,000 and 317,000 SNP loci, to detect chromosomal
	aberrations in samples bearing constitutional aberrations as well
	tumor samples at sub-100 kb effective resolution. Detected aberrations
	include homozygous deletions, hemizygous deletions, copy-neutral
	LOH, duplications, and amplifications. The statistical ability to
	detect common aberrations was modeled by analysis of an X chromosome
	titration model system, and sensitivity was modeled by titration
	of gDNA from a tumor cell with that of its paired normal cell line.
	Analysis was facilitated by using a genome browser that plots log
	ratios of normalized intensities and allelic ratios along the chromosomes.
	We developed two modes of SNP-CGH analysis, a single sample and a
	paired sample mode. The single sample mode computes log intensity
	ratios and allelic ratios by referencing to canonical genotype clusters
	generated from approximately 120 reference samples, whereas the paired
	sample mode uses a paired normal reference sample from the same individual.
	Finally, the two analysis modes are compared and contrasted for their
	utility in analyzing different types of input gDNA: low input amounts,
	fragmented gDNA, and Phi29 whole-genome pre-amplified DNA.},
