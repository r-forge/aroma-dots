  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Although copy-number aberrations are known to contribute
	to the diversity of the human DNA and cause various diseases, many
	aberrations and their phenotypes are still to be explored. The recent
	development of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays provides
	researchers with tools for calling genotypes and identifying chromosomal
	aberrations at an order-of-magnitude greater resolution than possible
	a few years ago. The fundamental problem in array-based copy-number
	(CN) analysis is to obtain CN estimates at a single-locus resolution
	with high accuracy and precision such that downstream segmentation
	methods are more likely to succeed. RESULTS: We propose a preprocessing
	method for estimating raw CNs from Affymetrix SNP arrays. Its core
	utilizes a multichip probe-level model analogous to that for high-density
	oligonucleotide expression arrays. We extend this model by adding
	an adjustment for sequence-specific allelic imbalances such as cross-hybridization
	between allele A and allele B probes. We focus on total CN estimates,
	which allows us to further constrain the probe-level model to increase
	the signal-to-noise ratio of CN estimates. Further improvement is
	obtained by controlling for PCR effects. Each part of the model is
	fitted robustly. The performance is assessed by quantifying how well
	raw CNs alone differentiate between one and two copies on Chromosome
	X (ChrX) at a single-locus resolution (27kb) up to a 200kb resolution.
	The evaluation is done with publicly available HapMap data. AVAILABILITY:
	The proposed method is available as part of an open-source R package
	named aroma.affymetrix. Because it is a bounded-memory algorithm,
	any number of arrays can be analyzed.},

  abstract = {Cancer results from somatic alterations in key genes, including point
	mutations, copy-number alterations and structural rearrangements.
	A powerful way to discover cancer-causing genes is to identify genomic
	regions that show recurrent copy-number alterations (gains and losses)
	in tumor genomes. Recent advances in sequencing technologies suggest
	that massively parallel sequencing may provide a feasible alternative
	to DNA microarrays for detecting copy-number alterations. Here we
	present: (i) a statistical analysis of the power to detect copy-number
	alterations of a given size; (ii) SegSeq, an algorithm to segment
	equal copy numbers from massively parallel sequence data; and (iii)
	analysis of experimental data from three matched pairs of tumor and
	normal cell lines. We show that a collection of approximately 14
	million aligned sequence reads from human cell lines has comparable
	power to detect events as the current generation of DNA microarrays
	and has over twofold better precision for localizing breakpoints
	(typically, to within approximately 1 kilobase).},
