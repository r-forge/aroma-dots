  abstract = {Affymetrix high-density oligonucleotide array is a tool that has the
	capacity to simultaneously measure the abundance of thousands of
	mRNA sequences in biological samples. In order to allow direct array-to-array
	comparisons, normalization is a necessity. When deciding on an appropriate
	normalization procedure there are a couple questions that need to
	be addressed, e.g., on which level should the normalization be performed:
	On the level of feature intensities or on the level of expression
	indexes? Should all features/expression indexes be used or can we
	choose a subset of features likely to be unregulated? Another question
	is how to actually perform the normalization: normalize using the
	overall mean intensity or use a smooth normalization curve? Most
	of the currently used normalization methods are linear; e.g., the
	normalization method implemented in the Affymetrix software GeneChip
	is based on the overall mean intensity. However, along with alternative
	methods of summarizing feature intensities into an expression index,
	nonlinear methods have recently started to appear. For many of these
	alternative methods, the natural choice is to normalize on the level
	of feature intensities, either using all feature intensities or only
	perfect match intensities. In this report, a nonlinear normalization
	procedure aimed for normalizing feature intensities is proposed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We have developed genomic tools to allow the genus Populus
	(aspens and cottonwoods) to be exploited as a full-featured model
	for investigating fundamental aspects of tree biology. We have undertaken
	large-scale expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing programs and
	created Populus microarrays with significant gene coverage. One of
	the important aspects of plant biology that cannot be studied in
	annual plants is the gene activity involved in the induction of autumn
	leaf senescence. RESULTS: On the basis of 36,354 Populus ESTs, obtained
	from seven cDNA libraries, we have created a DNA microarray consisting
	of 13,490 clones, spotted in duplicate. Of these clones, 12,376 (92\%)
	were confirmed by resequencing and all sequences were annotated and
	functionally classified. Here we have used the microarray to study
	transcript abundance in leaves of a free-growing aspen tree (Populus
	tremula) in northern Sweden during natural autumn senescence. Of
	the 13,490 spotted clones, 3,792 represented genes with significant
	expression in all leaf samples from the seven studied dates. CONCLUSIONS:
	We observed a major shift in gene expression, coinciding with massive
	chlorophyll degradation, that reflected a shift from photosynthetic
	competence to energy generation by mitochondrial respiration, oxidation
	of fatty acids and nutrient mobilization. Autumn senescence had much
	in common with senescence in annual plants; for example many proteases
	were induced. We also found evidence for increased transcriptional
	activity before the appearance of visible signs of senescence, presumably
	preparing the leaf for degradation of its components.},

	cell lines containing various X-chromosome numbers, and validated
	with DNA from cell lines with defined deletions and amplifications
	in other chromosomal locations. We applied this method to examine
	the copy number changes in DNA from 5 frozen gastrointestinal stromal

	with previously published results using conventional or BAC-array
	CGH, as well as novel changes in GIST tumors. These changes were
	concordant with results from Affymetrix 100K human SNP mapping arrays.
	Gene expression data for these GIST samples had previously been generated

	copy number and RNA expression levels. One of the novel aberrations
	identified in the GIST samples, a previously unreported gain on 1q21.1

	SOMATICs, an original program for accurate analysis of heterogeneous

	were processed through Illumina Beadarrays and then analyzed with
	SOMATICs. We demonstrate that tissue heterogeneity-related limitations
	not only can be overcome but can also be turned into an advantage.
	First, admixture of normal cells with tumor can be used as an internal
	reference, thereby enabling highly sensitive detection of somatic
	deletions without having corresponding normal tissue. Second, the
	presence of normal cells allows for discrimination of somatic from
	germline aberrations, and the proportion of cells in the tissue sample
	that are harboring the somatic events can be assessed. Third, relatively
	early versus late somatic events can also be distinguished, assuming
	that late events occur only in subsets of cancer cells. Finally,
	admixture by normal cells allows inference of germline genotypes
	from a cancer sample. All this information can be obtained from any
	cancer sample containing a proportion of 40-75\% of cancer cells.
	SOMATICs is a ready-to-use open-source program that integrates all

	and scoring of allelic ratios. This algorithm results in a more precise
	definition of CN and allelic aberration in the cancer genome, which

	The formula is generally accurate to order $O(n^{-1})$ or even $O(n^{-3/2})$,

	discussion of the formula and of certain relevant aspects of likelihood,
	the formula is used to motivate the definition of a modified profile

	of when the distribution formula is exact is considered, and in this
	connexion several new examples of exactness, including a bivariate
	generalization of the inverse Gaussian distribution, are adduced.
	The formula is shown also to be exact for arbitrary transformation
	models. To prove this it has been necessary to extend the basic theory
	of transformation models to cover the cases where the group action
	is not free. This extension, which appears of interest in itself,

	large amounts of data and knowledge about gene expression levels.
	However, interpretation of these data and turning it into biologically
	meaningful knowledge can be challenging. Frequently the output of
	such an analysis is a list of significant genes or a ranked list
	of genes. In the case of DNA microarray studies, data analysis often
	leads to lists of hundreds of differentially expressed genes. Also,
	clustering of gene expression data may lead to clusters of tens to
	hundreds of genes. These data are of little use if one is not able
	to interpret the results in a biological context. The Gene Ontology
	Consortium provides a controlled vocabulary to annotate the biological
	knowledge we have or that is predicted for a given gene. The Gene
	Ontologies (GOs) are organized as a hierarchy of annotation terms
	that facilitate an analysis and interpretation at different levels.
	The top-level ontologies are molecular function, biological process,
	and cellular component. Several annotation databases for genes of
	different organisms exist. This chapter describes how to use GO in
	order to help biologically interpret the lists of genes resulting
	from high-throughput experiments. It describes some statistical methods
	to find significantly over- or underrepresented GO terms within a
	list of genes and describes some tools and how to use them in order

	task in the analysis of aCGH data is the segmentation into groups
	of probes sharing the same DNA copy number. Some well known segmentation
	methods suffer from very long running times, preventing interactive
	data analysis. RESULTS: We suggest a new segmentation method based
	on wavelet decomposition and thresholding, which detects significant
	breakpoints in the data. Our algorithm is over 1000 times faster
	than leading approaches, with similar performance. Another key advantage
	of the proposed method is its simplicity and flexibility. Due to
	its intuitive structure, it can be easily generalized to incorporate
	several types of side information. Here, we consider two extensions
	which include side information indicating the reliability of each
	measurement, and compensating for a changing variability in the measurement
	noise. The resulting algorithm outperforms existing methods, both
	in terms of speed and performance, when applied on real high density

  number = {96},
  month = {feb},
  abstract = {Background: In an microarray experiment the difference in expression
	between genes on the same slide are up to 103 folded or more. At
	low expression, even a small error in the estimate will have great
	in uence on the final test and reference ratio. In addition to the
	true spot intensity the scanned signal consist of different kinds
	of noise, referred to as background, and in order to asses the true
	spot intensity the background must be subtracted. The standard method
	of estimating the background intensity is to assume it equal to the
	intensity between spots. In the literature, morphological opening
	has been suggested as one of the best methods to estimate this between
	spot intensity.
	
	
	Results: This paper examines fundamental properties of rank filter
	estimates including morphological filter estimates. The bias and
	variance of these filters are determined by the number of background
	pixels used and the pixel distribution.The rank filter algorithms
	are compared to methods available in the software Spot from CSIRO
	and GenePix by Axon Instruments. Morphological opening, in Spot,
	has a mean bias between -50 and -250 compared to a bias between 1
	and -2 for the rank filter and the variability of the morphological
	opening estimate is 3 times higher than for the rank filter. The
	mean bias of the second method in Spot, morphological close-opening,
	is between -5 and -15 and the variability is approximately the same
	as for morphological opening. The variability of the region based
	estimate of GenePix is ten times higher than the variability of the
	rank filter estimate and with slightly more bias. In addition to
	the GenePix estimate, a non-adaptive region based method is implemented.
	The bias and variability of this method is almost comparable to the
	rank filter.
	
	Conclusions: The performance of more advanced rank filters are equal
	to the best region based methods. However, great care must be taken
	when implementing these filters in order to get unbiased estimates.
	The performance of the previously suggested morphological opening
	is in general very poor with substantial spatial dependent bias.},

  abstract = {We have implemented a self-contained package for DNA microarray analysis
	in R. The package is named aroma and is formerly known as com.braju.sma.
	The purpose of the package is to provide end-users with easy access
	to the latest statistical tools and methods, to provide other statisticians
	with a structured platform to develop and test new analysis methods,
	and to make our methods available to an audience as broad as possible.
	In turn, this give us most valuable feedback for improving the package
	and its algorithms. The package provides methods for low-level analysis
	and pre-processing of spotted microarray data with two or more channels,
	although the recent methods are applicable to single-channel microarrays
	as well. Many of the commonly known and widely used normalization
	methods have been implemented as well as our own normalization and
	calibration methods in both early and mature versions. A few high-level
	analysis methods do exist. Import and export of microarray data is
	supported for most free and commercial file formats. Support for
	new ones can easily be added. Connectivity to other microarray analysis
	platforms based on relational databases is planned. For exploratory
	data analysis, the package provides a large set of methods for visualization
	of data with automatic graphical annotations. Textual and symbolic
	annotation of graphs is straightforward. Generated graphics can be
	exported for on-screen presentations and high-resolution printed
	publications. Report generators for simultaneously creating documents
	in plain text, HTML, and LaTeX are available, making it easy to create
	batch analysis scripts. Detailed documentation with code examples
	and references to the literature are included. In order to provide
	time and memory efficient algorithms, an object-oriented design and
	implementation utilizing reference variables has been used. In addition,
	to minimize the risk for programming mistakes, a consistent application
	protocol interface (API) was developed by enforcing an R coding convention.
	This will make it possible for a new user to quickly become familiar
	with the structure of classes and methods enhancing overall productivity.
	To further minimize the risk for programming errors, method arguments
	are validated as far as possible and explanatory error messages are
	used. Priority is also on backward compatibility with previous versions,
	compatibility with other packages, and potential future packages.
	The package does not provide a graphical user interface (GUI) per
	se, but the object-oriented API and the fact that reference variables
	are used make it easy for third-party developers to implement a GUI
	for, say, everyday high-throughput normalization. The package is
	available online as open source written in 100% R for maximum accessibility
	on all platforms. Installation is straightforward.},

  abstract = {Motivation:
	
	Although copy-number aberrations have shown to contribute to the diversity
	of the human DNA and to be the cause of various diseases, many more
	aberrations and their phenotypes are still to be explored. Recent
	developments of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays provide
	researchers with tools for calling genotypes and identifying chromosomal
	aberrations at an order-of-magnitude greater resolution than a few
	years ago. A fundamental problem in array-based copy-number analysis
	is to obtain raw copy-number estimates at a single-locus resolution
	with high accuracy and high precision such that downstream methods
	for identifying consequtive loci with copy-number changes are more
	likely to succeed.
	
	
	Results:
	
	We propose a novel method for estimating raw copy numbers from high-density
	Affymetrix SNP arrays. The core of the method utilizes a robust multichip
	probe-level model (PLM) analogue to that for high-density oligonucleotide
	expression arrays, which has been shown to outperform other methods.
	We improve this by introducing a robust model to control for sequence-specific
	allelic inbalances such as cross-hybridization between allele~A and
	allele~B probes. We focus on total copy-number estimates, which allows
	us to constrain the probe-level model to increase the signal-to-noise
	ratio of raw copy-number estimates further.
	
	Further improvement is obtained by controlling for PCR effects. The
	performance of the method is assessed by quantifying how well raw
	copy numbers alone differentiate between one and two copies on chromosome~X
	at a single-locus resolution (27kb) up to a 200kb resolution. The
	evaluation is done with publicly available HapMap data.
	
	
	Availability:
	
	The proposed method applies to all generations of SNP arrays and is

  volume = {7},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low-level processing and normalization of microarray data
	are most important steps in microarray analysis, which have profound
	impact on downstream analysis. Multiple methods have been suggested
	to date, but it is not clear which is the best. It is therefore important
	to further study the different normalization methods in detail and
	the nature of microarray data in general. RESULTS: A methodological
	study of affine models for gene expression data is carried out. Focus
	is on two-channel comparative studies, but the findings generalize
	also to single- and multi-channel data. The discussion applies to
	spotted as well as in-situ synthesized microarray data. Existing
	normalization methods such as curve-fit ("lowess") normalization,
	parallel and perpendicular translation normalization, and quantile
	normalization, but also dye-swap normalization are revisited in the
	light of the affine model and their strengths and weaknesses are
	investigated in this context. As a direct result from this study,
	we propose a robust non-parametric multi-dimensional affine normalization
	method, which can be applied to any number of microarrays with any
	number of channels either individually or all at once. A high-quality
	cDNA microarray data set with spike-in controls is used to demonstrate
	the power of the affine model and the proposed normalization method.
	CONCLUSION: We find that an affine model can explain non-linear intensity-dependent
	systematic effects in observed log-ratios. Affine normalization removes
	such artifacts for non-differentially expressed genes and assures
	that symmetry between negative and positive log-ratios is obtained,
	which is fundamental when identifying differentially expressed genes.
	In addition, affine normalization makes the empirical distributions
	in different channels more equal, which is the purpose of quantile
	normalization, and may also explain why dye-swap normalization works
	or fails. All methods are made available in the aroma package, which
	is a platform-independent package for R.},

  number = {2004:19},
  abstract = { Background: In this theoretical study we follow up our previous theoretical
	and applied work on affine calibration and normalization methods
	by suggesting a stochastic affine model for two- or multi-channel
	microarrays containing dilution series. With replicated probes (spots)
	at various, not necessarily known, concentration levels it is possible
	to identify the channel biases uniquely. For this to be true it is
	necessary that some genes are differentially expressed, but which
	they are or what their relative gene-expression levels are do not
	have to be known. The method presented may also be applied to so
	called spike-in data. From the maximum likelihood estimator, estimates
	of the relative gene-expression levels for all dilution series follow
	directly. Given the estimated channel biases and scale factors, back
	transformation gives calibrated probe signals that are proportional
	to the amount of fluorophore in each channel. With the assumption
	that most genes are non-differentially expressed, the proposed calibration
	method makes the signals in each channel proportional to the corresponding
	gene-expression levels. Results: The model suggested is a heteroscedastic
	affine model where the standard deviations of the error terms are
	equal for all replicates that belong to the same gene, but may vary
	freely between genes. For a specific probe, the standard deviation
	in one channel is assumed to be proportional to the other channels.
	These constraints were chosen as a compromise between model flexibility
	and feasible parameter estimates. We investigate the properties of
	the parameter estimates from simulated data by comparing bootstrap
	and asymptotic confidence intervals based on normal approximation
	for different setups of number of genes and replicates. We simulate
	two-channel gene-expression data with technical dilution series from
	the suggested model and, in order to investigate the robustness of
	the estimator against model misspecification, a more general model
	for which the standard deviations are not only proportional to the
	gene-expression levels, but also the probe concentrations. We find
	that the standard deviation of the bias-parameter estimates is inversely
	proportional to the square root of the product of the number genes
	and replicates, provided the latter is not too small. For modest
	number of replicates, the standard deviation based on the Fisher
	information is a good approximation to the bootstrap ditto. When
	too few replicates are available, normality can not be assumed and
	the standard errors are under-estimated. For similar reasons, for
	different setups of number of genes and replicates such that the
	total number of probes are the same, we found that it is better to
	use more replicates and fewer genes, if possible. Comparing dilution
	series with uniformly and logarithmic-uniformly distributed concentrations
	better results are obtained using the latter. Availability: All methods
	have been implemented in the cross-platform R package called aroma,
	which is available for free from http://www.braju.com/R/.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-linearities in observed log-ratios of gene expressions,
	also known as intensity dependent log-ratios, can often be accounted
	for by global biases in the two channels being compared. Any step
	in a microarray process may introduce such offsets and in this article
	we study the biases introduced by the microarray scanner and the
	image analysis software. RESULTS: By scanning the same spotted oligonucleotide
	microarray at different photomultiplier tube (PMT) gains, we have
	identified a channel-specific bias present in two-channel microarray
	data. For the scanners analyzed it was in the range of 15-25 (out
	of 65,535). The observed bias was very stable between subsequent
	scans of the same array although the PMT gain was greatly adjusted.
	This indicates that the bias does not originate from a step preceding
	the scanner detector parts. The bias varies slightly between arrays.
	When comparing estimates based on data from the same array, but from
	different scanners, we have found that different scanners introduce
	different amounts of bias. So do various image analysis methods.
	We propose a scanning protocol and a constrained affine model that
	allows us to identify and estimate the bias in each channel. Backward
	transformation removes the bias and brings the channels to the same
	scale. The result is that systematic effects such as intensity dependent
	log-ratios are removed, but also that signal densities become much
	more similar. The average scan, which has a larger dynamical range
	and greater signal-to-noise ratio than individual scans, can then
	be obtained. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that microarray scanners
	may introduce a significant bias in each channel. Such biases have
	to be calibrated for, otherwise systematic effects such as intensity
	dependent log-ratios will be observed. The proposed scanning protocol
	and calibration method is simple to use and is useful for evaluating
	scanner biases or for obtaining calibrated measurements with extended

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: The rapid expansion of whole-genome copy number (CN) studies
	brings a demand for increased precision and resolution of CN estimates.
	Recent studies have obtained CN estimates from more than one platform
	for the same set of samples, and it is natural to want to combine
	the different estimates in order to meet this demand. Estimates from
	different platforms show different degrees of attenuation of the
	true CN changes. Similar differences can be observed in CNs from
	the same platform run in different labs, or in the same lab, with
	different analytical methods. This is the reason why it is not straightforward
	to combine CN estimates from different sources (platforms, labs and
	analysis methods). RESULTS: We propose a single-sample multi source
	normalization that brings full-resolution CN estimates to the same
	scale across sources. The normalized CNs are such that for any underlying
	CN level, their mean level is the same regardless of the source,
	which make them better suited for being combined across sources,
	e.g. existing segmentation methods may be used to identify aberrant
	regions. We use microarray-based CN estimates from 'The Cancer Genome
	Atlas' (TCGA) project to illustrate and validate the method. We show
	that the normalized and combined data better separate two CN states
	at a given resolution. We conclude that it is possible to combine
	CNs from multiple sources such that the resolution becomes effectively
	larger, and when multiple platforms are combined, they also enhance
	the genome coverage by complementing each other in different regions.

	for analyzing Affymetrix data sets consisting of 1 to 1,000s of arrays.
	By working directly with CDF and CEL files (standard Affymetrix file
	formats) most chip types are automatically supported, e.g. expression,
	SNP, and exon arrays. The package provides methods for low-level
	analysis such as background correction of different kinds, allelic
	cross-talk calibration, quantile and affine normalization, PCR fragment-length
	and GC-content normalization, probe-level summarization such as robust
	log-additive and multiplicative modeling, as well as a set of methods
	for high-level analysis, e.g. chromosomal segmentation and alternative
	splicing. Results can be exported to dynamical HTML reports for easy
	navigation of a large set of arrays both offline and online. All
	algorithms have been optimized to run in bounded memory (as low as
	500MB of RAM) by either redesigning the algorithms or by processing
	data in chunks. Transformed data and parameter estimates are stored
	on file in standard file formats, which in turn minimizes the memory
	overhead, but also makes them immediately accessible to other software.
	Moreover, storing intermediate results in persistent memory makes
	computational expensive analyses more robust against system failures
	and allows for quick resumes. In addition to making common algorithms
	readily available, this package was designed to allow for quicker
	development of novel models and incorporation of existing ones, such
	as Bioconductor methods, and be prepared for future chip types.

	High-resolution copy-number (CN) analysis have in recent years gained

	Results: 
	
	As with our method for earlier generations of arrays, this one controls

	crosstalk, probe affinities and PCR fragment-length effects. Additionally,
	it also corrects
	
	for probe-sequence effects and co-hybridization of fragments digested

	within each probe. The effect of SNPs is quite severe and leads to
	considerable false-positive rates, particularly when the analysis

	Here we describe a systematic method, called Genomic Identification

	a highly concordant picture involving approximately 35 significant

	16-21 focal events. Approximately half of these events correspond
	to known cancer-related genes, only some of which have been previously
	tied to glioma. We also show that superimposed broad and focal events
	may have different biological consequences. Specifically, gliomas
	with broad amplification of chromosome 7 have properties different
	from those with overlapping focalEGFR amplification: the broad events

	Results: We analyzed the signal intensities of GeneChip microarrays

	a microscopic binding model. It considers specific and non-specific

	the ends of the X and Y chromosomes and encompass roughly 2.7 Mb
	(PAR1) and 0.33 Mb (PAR2). As a major asset of recently available
	sequence data, our view of their structural characteristics could
	be refined considerably. While PAR2 resembles the overall sequence
	composition of the X chromosome and exhibits only slightly elevated
	recombination rates, PAR1 is characterized by a significantly higher
	GC content and a completely different repeat structure. In addition,
	it exhibits one of the highest recombination frequencies throughout

	features, displays a significantly faster rate of evolution. It therefore
	represents an exceptional model to explore the correlation between
	meiotic recombination and evolutionary forces such as gene mutation
	and conversion. At least twenty-nine genes lie within the human pseudoautosomal
	regions, and these genes exhibit 'autosomal' rather than sex-specific
	inheritance. All genes within PAR1 escape X inactivation and are
	therefore candidates for the etiology of haploinsufficiency disorders

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: To distinguish new primary breast cancers from true recurrences,
	pangenomic analyses of DNA copy number alterations (CNAs) using single-nucleotide
	polymorphism arrays have proven useful. METHODS: The pangenomic profiles
	of 22 pairs of primary breast carcinoma (ductal or lobular) and ipsilateral
	breast cancers from the same patients were analyzed. Hierarchical
	clustering was performed using CNAs and DNA breakpoint information.
	A partial identity score developed using DNA breakpoint information
	was used to quantify partial identities between two tumors. The nature
	of ipsilateral breast cancers (true recurrence vs new primary tumor)
	as defined using the clustering methods and the partial identity
	score was compared with that based on clinical characteristics. Metastasis-free
	survival was compared among patients with primary tumors and true
	recurrences as defined using the partial identity score and by clinical
	characteristics. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: All
	methods agreed on the nature of ipsilateral breast cancers for 14
	pairs of samples. For five pairs, the clinical definition disagreed
	with both clustering methods. For three pairs, the two clustering
	methods were discordant and the one using DNA breakpoints agreed
	with the clinical definition. The partial identity score confirmed
	the nature of ipsilateral breast cancers as defined by clustering
	of DNA breakpoints in 21 of 22 pairs. The difference in metastasis-free
	survival of patients with new primary tumors and those with true
	recurrences was not statistically significant when tumors were defined
	based on clinical and histologic characteristics (5-year metastasis-free
	survival: 76\%, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 52\% to 100\% for
	new primary tumors and 38\%, 95\% CI = 17\% to 83\% for true recurrences;
	P = .18; new primary tumor vs true recurrence, hazard ratio = 2.8,
	95\% CI = 0.6 to 13.7), but the difference was statistically significant
	when tumors were defined using the partial identity score (5-year
	metastasis-free survival: 100\% for new primary tumors and 29\%,
	95\% CI = 11\% to 78\% for true recurrences; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS:
	DNA breakpoint information more often agreed with the clinical determination
	than CNAs in this population. The partial identity score, which was
	calculated based on DNA breakpoints, allows statistical discrimination
	between new primary tumors and true recurrences that could outperform
	the clinical determination in terms of prognosis.},

	oligonucleotide arrays, it is important to remove sources of variation
	between arrays of non-biological origin. Normalization is a process
	for reducing this variation. It is common to see non-linear relations

	does not perform well in these situations. RESULTS: We present three
	methods of performing normalization at the probe intensity level.
	These methods are called complete data methods because they make
	use of data from all arrays in an experiment to form the normalizing
	relation. These algorithms are compared to two methods that make
	use of a baseline array: a one number scaling based algorithm and
	a method that uses a non-linear normalizing relation by comparing
	the variability and bias of an expression measure. Two publicly available
	datasets are used to carry out the comparisons. The simplest and
	quickest complete data method is found to perform favorably. AVAILABILITY:

  title = {Low-level Analysis of High-density Oligonucleotide Array Data: Background,
	Normalization and Summarization},
  school = {University of California, Berkeley},
  year = {2004},
  abstract = {Microarray experiments are currently widely applied in many areas
	of biomedical research. The
	
	Affymetrix GeneChip system is a commercial high-density oligonucleotide
	microarray platform
	
	which measures gene expression using hundreds of thousands of 25-mer
	oligonucleotide probes.
	
	This dissertation addresses how probe intensity data from GeneChips
	are processed to produce
	
	gene expression values and shows how better pre-processing leads to
	gene expression measures,
	
	that after further analysis, yield biologically meaningful conclusions.
	An ideal expression measure
	
	isone which is both precise and accurate.
	
	
	A three-stage procedure for producing an expression measure is proposed.
	For each of the three
	
	stages, background correction, normalization and summarization, numerous
	methods are developed
	
	and assessed using spike-in datasets. Bias and variance criteria are
	used to compare the different
	
	methods of producing expression values. The methods are also judged
	by how well they correctly
	
	identify the differential genes. The background method has a signi?cant
	effect on the bias, which
	
	is reduced, and the variability, which is usually increased. Non-linear
	normalization methods are
	
	found to reduce the non-biological variability between multiple arrays
	without introducing any
	
	significant bias. Robust multi-chip linear models are found to fit
	the data well and provide the 
	
	recommended summarization method.
	
	
	The summarization methodology is extended to produce test statistics
	for determining differential
	
	genes. These test statistics perform favorably at correctly detecting
	differential genes when
	
	compared with alternative methods based on expression values. Finally,
	using case study data, no
	
	statistical benefit is found for using arrays hybridized with mRNA
	from a pool rather than from a
	
	single biological source.},

	a given stochastic data model. The other uses algorithmic models
	and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community
	has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This
	commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions,
	and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting
	current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice,
	has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used
	both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative
	alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as
	a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away
	from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse
	set of tools.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Comparative genomic hybridization array experiments that
	investigate gene copy number changes present new challenges for statistical
	analysis and call for methods that incorporate spatial dependence
	between sequences along the chromosome. For this purpose, we propose
	a novel method called CGHmix. It is based on a spatially structured
	mixture model with three states corresponding to genomic sequences
	that are either unmodified, deleted or amplified. Inference is performed
	in a Bayesian framework. From the output, posterior probabilities
	of belonging to each of the three states are estimated for each genomic
	sequence and used to classify them. RESULTS: Using simulated data,
	CGHmix is validated and compared with both a conventional unstructured
	mixture model and with a recently proposed data mining method. We
	demonstrate the good performance of CGHmix for classifying copy number
	changes. In addition, the method provides a good estimate of the
	false discovery rate. We also present the analysis of a cancer related

  abstract = {Human cancers often carry many somatically acquired genomic rearrangements,
	some of which may be implicated in cancer development. However, conventional
	strategies for characterizing rearrangements are laborious and low-throughput
	and have low sensitivity or poor resolution. We used massively parallel
	sequencing to generate sequence reads from both ends of short DNA
	fragments derived from the genomes of two individuals with lung cancer.
	By investigating read pairs that did not align correctly with respect
	to each other on the reference human genome, we characterized 306
	germline structural variants and 103 somatic rearrangements to the
	base-pair level of resolution. The patterns of germline and somatic
	rearrangement were markedly different. Many somatic rearrangements
	were from amplicons, although rearrangements outside these regions,
	notably including tandem duplications, were also observed. Some somatic
	rearrangements led to abnormal transcripts, including two from internal
	tandem duplications and two fusion transcripts created by interchromosomal
	rearrangements. Germline variants were predominantly mediated by
	retrotransposition, often involving AluY and LINE elements. The results
	demonstrate the feasibility of systematic, genome-wide characterization
	of rearrangements in complex human cancer genomes, raising the prospect
	of a new harvest of genes associated with cancer using this strategy.},

	and disease, but its regulation in humans is not well understood,
	partially because of the limited scale at which the expression of
	specific splicing events has been measured. We generated the first
	genome-scale expression compendium of human alternative splicing
	events using custom whole-transcript microarrays monitoring expression
	of 24,426 alternative splicing events in 48 diverse human samples.
	Over 11,700 genes and 9,500 splicing events were differentially expressed,
	providing a rich resource for studying splicing regulation. An unbiased,
	systematic screen of 21,760 4-mer to 7-mer words for cis-regulatory
	motifs identified 143 RNA 'words' enriched near regulated cassette
	exons, including six clusters of motifs represented by UCUCU, UGCAUG,
	UGCU, UGUGU, UUUU and AGGG, which map to trans-acting regulators
	PTB, Fox, Muscleblind, CELF/CUG-BP, TIA-1 and hnRNP F/H, respectively.
	Each cluster showed a distinct pattern of genomic location and tissue
	specificity. For example, UCUCU occurs 110 to 35 nucleotides preceding
	cassette exons upregulated in brain and striated muscle but depleted
	in other tissues. UCUCU and UGCAUG seem to have similar function
	but independent action, occurring 5' and 3', respectively, of 33\%
	of the cassette exons upregulated in skeletal muscle but co-occurring
	for only 2\%.},

	in tumorigenesis and tumor progression. Many studies have shown that
	copy-number abnormalities at the DNA level are important in the pathogenesis
	of cancer. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), developed
	based on expression microarray technology, can reveal the chromosomal
	aberrations in segmental copies at a high resolution. However, due
	to the nature of aCGH, many standard expression data processing tools,
	such as data normalization, often fail to yield satisfactory results.
	RESULTS: We demonstrated a novel aCGH normalization algorithm, which
	provides an accurate aCGH data normalization by utilizing the dependency
	of neighboring probe measurements in aCGH experiments. To facilitate
	the study, we have developed a hidden Markov model (HMM) to simulate
	a series of aCGH experiments with random DNA copy number alterations
	that are used to validate the performance of our normalization. In
	addition, we applied the proposed normalization algorithm to an aCGH
	study of lung cancer cell lines. By using the proposed algorithm,
	data quality and the reliability of experimental results are significantly
	improved, and the distinct patterns of DNA copy number alternations
	are observed among those lung cancer cell lines. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

  abstract = {From microarray measurement, we seek differentiation of mRNA expressions
	among different biological samples. However, each array has a 'block
	effect' due to uncontrolled variation. The statistical treatment
	of reducing the block effect is usually referred to as normalization.
	Our perspective is to find a transformation that matches the distributions
	of hybridization levels of those probes corresponding to undifferentiated
	genes between arrays. We address two important issues. First, array-specific
	spatial patterns exist due to uneven hybridization and measurement
	process. Second, in some cases a substantially large portion of genes
	are differentially expressed between a target and a reference array.
	For the purpose of normalization we need to identify a subset that
	exclude those probes corresponding to differentially expressed genes
	and abnormal probes due to experimental variation. Least trimmed
	squares (LTS) is a natural choice to achieve this goal. Substantial
	differentiation is protected in LTS by setting an appropriate trimming
	fraction. To take into account any spatial pattern of hybridization,
	we divide each array into sub-arrays and normalize probe intensities
	within each sub-array. We illustrate the problem and solution through
	an Affymetrix spike-in dataset with defined perturbation and a dataset

	number changes (aneuploidies) in the human genome. Recent studies

	Objective Bayes measures are used to set certain hyperparameters
	in the priors using a novel re-sampling framework to calibrate the
	model to a fixed Type I (false positive) error rate. Other parameters
	are set via maximum marginal likelihood to prior training data of

	of segmental aneuploidy identification and mapping, relative to existing
	analytical tools (Beadstudio, Illumina), as demonstrated by validation
	of breakpoint boundaries. QuantiSNP identified both novel and validated
	CNVs. QuantiSNP was developed using BeadArray SNP data but it can
	be adapted to other platforms and we believe that the OB-HMM framework

	the International HapMap Project to produce the first high-resolution
	population surveys of deletion polymorphism. Approximately 100 of
	these deletions have been experimentally validated using comparative
	genome hybridization on tiling-resolution oligonucleotide microarrays.
	Our analysis identifies a total of 586 distinct regions that harbor
	deletion polymorphisms in one or more of the families. Notably, we
	estimate that typical individuals are hemizygous for roughly 30-50
	deletions larger than 5 kb, totaling around 550-750 kb of euchromatic
	sequence across their genomes. The detected deletions span a total
	of 267 known and predicted genes. Overall, however, the deleted regions
	are relatively gene-poor, consistent with the action of purifying
	selection against deletions. Deletion polymorphisms may well have
	an important role in the genetics of complex traits; however, they
	are not directly observed in most current gene mapping studies. Our

	coverage on the genome is desirable and often an essential requirement
	for population genetics studies. Region-specific or chromosome-specific
	linkage studies also benefit from the availability of as many high
	quality SNPs as possible. The availability of millions of SNPs from
	both Perlegen and the public domain and the development of an efficient
	microarray-based assay for genotyping SNPs has brought up some interesting
	analytical challenges. Effective methods for the selection of optimal
	subsets of SNPs spanning the genome and methods for accurately calling
	genotypes from probe hybridization patterns have enabled the development
	of a new microarray-based system for robustly genotyping over 100,000
	SNPs per sample. RESULTS: We introduce a new dynamic model-based
	algorithm (DM) for screening over 3 million SNPs and genotyping over
	100,000 SNPs. The model is based on four possible underlying states:
	Null, A, AB and B for each probe quartet. We calculate a probe-level
	log likelihood for each model and then select between the four competing
	models with an SNP-level statistical aggregation across multiple
	probe quartets to provide a high-quality genotype call along with
	a quality measure of the call. We assess performance with HapMap
	reference genotypes, informative Mendelian inheritance relationship
	in families, and consistency between DM and another genotype classification
	method. At a call rate of 95.91\% the concordance with reference
	genotypes from the HapMap Project is 99.81\% based on over 1.5 million
	genotypes, the Mendelian error rate is 0.018\% based on 10 trios,
	and the consistency between DM and MPAM is 99.90\% at a comparable
	rate of 97.18\%. We also develop methods for SNP selection and optimal
	probe selection. AVAILABILITY: The DM algorithm is available in Affymetrix's

  abstract = {The interfaculty research center Intelligent Molecular Diagnostic
	Systems employs chemistry in microarrays, fluorescence reading, and
	bioinformatics to gain insight into the metabolic regulation of the
	glycolytic pathway. In this research program silicon-based labs-on-chips
	are being developed; each vial on the microarray will be equipped
	with various sensors and actuators. With this kind of microarray
	technology enormous amounts of data will be generated. Development
	of dedicated data analysis and data interpretation systems is necessary
	to extract useful information from the experimental data and to combine
	that with present data and knowledge. Currently, the enzyme-catalyzed
	reactions of this pathway can be monitored in microarrays via the
	production or consumption of NADH. The activity levels of the enzymes
	involved in the reactions can be derived from the production or consumption
	rates of this fluorescent molecule. The biochemical reactions are
	monitored with a modified conventional microscope system equipped
	with a scientific grade CCD camera. With low power optics fluorescent
	signals from an entire microarray can be acquired in a single image.
	This allows for a parallel readout of the microarray. Wide field-of-view
	imaging, however, is at the expense of absolute sensitivity. High
	power optics guarantees a high collection efficiency, but implies
	a sequential readout of the microarray. With this kind of microarray
	reading system, there are two possible limiting factors in the instrument
	that determine the lowest detectable concentration of fluorescent
	particles. These limiting factors are stray light and readout noise.
	If readout noise limits the detection, then the detection limit can
	be lowered by imaging the fluorescent signal onto as few pixels as
	possible. This can be accomplished by choosing a CCD camera with
	large pixels, where each pixel has a low readout noise level. A second
	modification is to demagnify the image by placing a second objective
	back-to-back to the primary objective lens in the emission path.
	If stray light limits the detection, then a better detector will
	not result in a lower detection limit, since it will not improve
	the signal-to-noise ratio of the measurements. Applying the same
	modifications to the microscope system will result in a faster scanning
	rate of the microarray. We have demonstrated the functionality of
	our conventional microscope-based microarray reader for this research
	program by monitoring an NADH producing and consuming reaction at
	different enzyme activity levels in the microarrays. Monitoring Dynamic
	Liquid Behavior in Micromachined Vials. Evaporation is a key problem
	in the development of micrarray technology, especially in the case
	of open reactors. Within the framework of this research program methods
	to avoid fast evaporation of solvents have been developed. Still,
	the process of evaporation at a nanoliter scale is an interesting
	phenomenon to study, and a requirement for calibration of a dedicated
	impedance based volume sensor. Quantitative measurements of the dynamic
	process of evaporation in the vials of our microarrays requires sufficient
	spatial (lateral and axial) as well as temporal sampling. Interference-contrast
	microscopy is a technique that satisfies both sampling requirements.
	With this technique an interference pattern is generated at the air-liquid
	interface of the evaporating liquid sample. This interference pattern
	shows fringes of equal height. With a temporal phase unwrapping algorithm
	these fringe patterns are analyzed in time point-by-point. With this
	algorithm the height profile of the air-liquid interface can be reconstructed
	without using any spatial correlating function. The instant that
	the air-liquid interface is perfectly flat is used to calibrate all
	one-dimensional height maps. Applying this technique to reconstruct
	the shape of the interface that generated this fringe pattern requires
	only spatial sampling at half the Nyquist frequency, whereas a spatial
	phase unwrapping technique requires spatial sampling at the Nyquist
	frequency. A straightforward measurement from these results is the
	remaining liquid volume as a function of time, and from that the
	evaporation rate. A counterintuitive result is that the evaporation
	rate is proportional to the perimeter of the vial, and not to the
	area of the air-liquid interface. This can be explained by the fact
	that the liquid is pinned to the edge of the vial and that diffusion
	is the rate limiting step of the evaporation process. Furthermore,
	when there are objects present on the bottom of the vials, these
	objects introduce phase differences in the interference pattern,
	which are observed as segmented fringes. Spatial phase unwrapping
	algorithms will fail analyzing patterns with segmented fringes. A
	temporal phase unwrapping algorithm, however, is insensitive for
	these kind of segmented fringes. With this technique it is possible
	to measure the height of objects on a nanometer scale. },

  abstract = {We have addressed two important issues of nonlinear cross-talk and
	baseline adjustment in DNA data processing. An important aspect in
	the processing of the four-dye fluorescence-based data is the cross-talk
	filtering. Typically, a matrix M, which is a function of the fluorophores
	and the fluorescence detection system, is used in the multicomponent
	analysis. In this deconvolution process the matrix is applied directly
	to the raw signal, on a linear cross-talk assumption. This necessitates
	the signal to be aligned to the baseline before the filter is applied.
	The various techniques used for aligning the raw data have the negative
	effect of adding distortion to the signal. An algorithm for cross-talk
	removal is presented in this paper. The algorithm uses the intensity
	difference of the signal rather than the actual value itself, thus
	making the cross-talk removal possible before the base line adjustment.
	In addition, a supplementary filtering step is proposed in order
	to account for the nonlinear nature of the cross-talk. This second
	step is based on a matrix T that accounts for the correlation of
	each of the signals with the other three. The overall result is a
	more precise presentation of the DNA data and less information loss

	This paper describes statistical methods for the identification of
	differentially expressed genes in replicated cDNA microarray experiments.
	Although it is not the main focus of the paper, we stress the importance
	of issues such as image processing and normalization. Image processing
	is required to extract measures of transcript abundance for each
	gene spotted on the array from the laser scan images. Normalization
	is needed to identify and remove systematic sources of variation,
	such as differing dye labeling efficiencies and scanning properties.
	There can be many systematic sources of variation and their effects
	can be large relative to the effects of interest. After a brief presentation
	of our image processing method, we describe a within-slide normalization
	approach which handles spatial and intensity dependent effects on
	the measured expression levels. Given suitably normalized data, our
	proposed method for the identification of single differentially expressed
	genes is to consider a univariate testing problem for each gene and
	then correct for multiple testing using adjusted p-values. No specific
	parametric form is assumed for the distribution of the expression
	levels and a permutation procedure is used to estimate the joint
	null distribution of the test statistics for each gene. Several data
	displays are suggested for the visual identification of genes with
	altered expression and of important features of these genes. The
	above methods are applied to microarray data from a study of gene
	expression in two mouse models with very low HDL cholesterol levels.
	The genes identified using data from replicated slides are compared
	to those obtained by applying recently published single-slide methods.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microarray comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is
	currently one of the most powerful techniques to measure DNA copy
	number in large genomes. In humans, microarray CGH is widely used
	to assess copy number variants in healthy individuals and copy number
	aberrations associated with various diseases, syndromes and disease
	susceptibility. In model organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans
	(C. elegans) the technique has been applied to detect mutations,
	primarily deletions, in strains of interest. Although various constraints
	on oligonucleotide properties have been suggested to minimize non-specific
	hybridization and improve the data quality, there have been few experimental
	validations for CGH experiments. For genomic regions where strict
	design filters would limit the coverage it would also be useful to
	quantify the expected loss in data quality associated with relaxed
	design criteria. RESULTS: We have quantified the effects of filtering
	various oligonucleotide properties by measuring the resolving power
	for detecting deletions in the human and C. elegans genomes using
	NimbleGen microarrays. Approximately twice as many oligonucleotides
	are typically required to be affected by a deletion in human DNA
	samples in order to achieve the same statistical confidence as one
	would observe for a deletion in C. elegans. Surprisingly, the ability
	to detect deletions strongly depends on the oligonucleotide 15-mer
	count, which is defined as the sum of the genomic frequency of all
	the constituent 15-mers within the oligonucleotide. A similarity
	level above 80\% to non-target sequences over the length of the probe
	produces significant cross-hybridization. We recommend the use of
	a fairly large melting temperature window of up to 10 degrees C,
	the elimination of repeat sequences, the elimination of homopolymers
	longer than 5 nucleotides, and a threshold of -1 kcal/mol on the
	oligonucleotide self-folding energy. We observed very little difference
	in data quality when varying the oligonucleotide length between 50
	and 70, and even when using an isothermal design strategy. CONCLUSION:
	We have determined experimentally the effects of varying several
	key oligonucleotide microarray design criteria for detection of deletions
	in C. elegans and humans with NimbleGen's CGH technology. Our oligonucleotide
	design recommendations should be applicable for CGH analysis in most

	significant upregulation. Conversely, we identified 302 gene upregulations
	and 56 downregulations when comparing 21\% O(2) (p0p10) with 2\%
	O2 (p10). These significantly upregulated changes clustered into
	82 over-represented and 9 under-represented ontology terms. These
	terms were indicative of signaling pathways, developmental potential

	changes associated with 2\% O2 culture may be predictive of novel
	cellular requirements for stable self-renewal, maintenance of pluripotency,
	and a reduction of hESC-line heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Genomic DNA copy number aberrations are frequent
	in solid tumors, although the underlying causes of chromosomal instability
	in tumors remain obscure. Genes likely to have genomic instability
	phenotypes when mutated (e.g. those involved in mitosis, replication,
	repair, and telomeres) are rarely mutated in chromosomally unstable
	sporadic tumors, even though such mutations are associated with some
	heritable cancer prone syndromes. METHODS: We applied array comparative
	genomic hybridization (CGH) to the analysis of breast tumors. The
	variation in the levels of genomic instability amongst tumors prompted
	us to investigate whether alterations in processes/genes involved
	in maintenance and/or manipulation of the genome were associated
	with particular types of genomic instability. RESULTS: We discriminated
	three breast tumor subtypes based on genomic DNA copy number alterations.
	The subtypes varied with respect to level of genomic instability.
	We find that shorter telomeres and altered telomere related gene
	expression are associated with amplification, implicating telomere
	attrition as a promoter of this type of aberration in breast cancer.
	On the other hand, the numbers of chromosomal alterations, particularly
	low level changes, are associated with altered expression of genes
	in other functional classes (mitosis, cell cycle, DNA replication
	and repair). Further, although loss of function instability phenotypes
	have been demonstrated for many of the genes in model systems, we
	observed enhanced expression of most genes in tumors, indicating
	that over expression, rather than deficiency underlies instability.
	CONCLUSIONS: Many of the genes associated with higher frequency of
	copy number aberrations are direct targets of E2F, supporting the
	hypothesis that deregulation of the Rb pathway is a major contributor
	to chromosomal instability in breast tumors. These observations are
	consistent with failure to find mutations in sporadic tumors in genes
	that have roles in maintenance or manipulation of the genome.},

  abstract = {While scientific research and the methodologies involved have gone
	through substantial technological evolution the technology involved
	in the publication of the results of these endeavors has remained
	relatively stagnant. Publication is largely done in the same manner
	today as it was fifty years ago. Many journals have adopted electronic
	formats, however, their orientation and style is little different
	from a printed document. The documents tend to be static and take
	little advantage of computational resources that might be available.
	Recent work, Gentleman and Temple Lang (2003), suggests a methodology
	and basic infrastructure that can be used to publish documents in
	a substantially different way. Their approach is suitable for the
	publication of papers whose message relies on computation. Stated
	quite simply, Gentleman and Temple Lang (2003) propose a paradigm
	where documents are mixtures of code and text. Such documents may
	be self-contained or they may be a component of a compendium which
	provides the infrastructure needed to provide access to data and
	supporting software. These documents, or compendiums, can be processed
	in a number of different ways. One transformation will be to replace
	the code with its output -- thereby providing the familiar, but limited,
	static document. <p /> In this paper we apply these concepts to a
	seminal paper in bioinformatics, namely The Molecular Classification
	of Cancer, Golub et al (1999). The authors of that paper have generously
	provided data and other information that have allowed us to largely
	reproduce their results. Rather than reproduce this paper exactly
	we demonstrate that such a reproduction is possible and instead concentrate
	on demonstrating the usefulness of the compendium concept itself.},

	the computations and code used in data analyses, methodological descriptions,
	simulations, etc. with the documents that describe and rely on them.
	This integration allows readers to both verify and adapt the statements
	in the documents. Authors can easily reproduce them in the future,
	and they can present the document's contents in a different medium,
	e.g. with interactive controls. This paper describes a software framework
	for authoring and distributing these integrated, dynamic documents
	that contain text, code, data, and any auxiliary content needed to
	recreate the computations. The documents are dynamic in that the
	contents, including figures, tables, etc., can be recalculated each
	time a view of the document is generated. Our model treats a dynamic
	document as a master or ``source'' document from which one can generate
	different views in the form of traditional, derived documents for
	different audiences.
	
	
	 We introduce the concept of a compendium as both a container for
	the different elements that make up the document and its computations
	(i.e. text, code, data, ...), and as a means for distributing, managing
	and updating the collection.
	
	
	 The step from disseminating analyses via a compendium to reproducible
	research is a small one. By reproducible research, we mean research
	papers with accompanying software tools that allow the reader to
	directly reproduce the results and employ the methods that are presented
	in the research paper. Some of the issues involved in paradigms for
	the production, distribution and use of such reproducible research

	We address the statistical computation requirements for optimizing
	data acquisition and processing of digital scans. We consider the
	use of median filters to reduce noise levels in images and top-hat
	filters to correct for trends in background values. We also consider,
	as alternative estimators of spot intensity, discs of fixed radius,
	proportions of histograms and k-means clustering, either with or
	without a square-root intensity transformation and background subtraction.
	We identify, using combinatoric procedures, optimal filter and estimator
	parameters, in achieving consistency among the replicates of a gene
	on each microarray. Our results, using test data from microarrays
	of HCMV, indicate that a highly effective approach for improving
	reliability and quality of microarray data is to apply a 21 by 21
	top-hat filter, then estimate spot intensity as the mean of the largest
	20\% of pixel values in the target region, after a square-root transformation,

  abstract = {PURPOSE: This study was designed to elucidate the role of amplification
	at 8q24 in the pathophysiology of ovarian and breast cancer because
	increased copy number at this locus is one of the most frequent genomic
	abnormalities in these cancers. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To accomplish
	this, we assessed the association of amplification at 8q24 with outcome
	in ovarian cancers using fluorescence in situ hybridization to tissue
	microarrays and measured responses of ovarian and breast cancer cell
	lines to specific small interfering RNAs against the oncogene MYC
	and a putative noncoding RNA, PVT1, both of which map to 8q24. RESULTS:
	Amplification of 8q24 was associated with significantly reduced survival
	duration. In addition, small interfering RNA-mediated reduction in
	either PVT1 or MYC expression inhibited proliferation in breast and
	ovarian cancer cell lines in which they were both amplified and overexpressed
	but not in lines in which they were not amplified/overexpressed.
	Inhibition of PVT1 expression also induced a strong apoptotic response
	in cell lines in which it was overexpressed but not in lines in which
	it was not amplified/overexpressed. Inhibition of MYC, on the other
	hand, did not induce an apoptotic response in cell lines in which
	MYC was amplified and overexpressed. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest
	that MYC and PVT1 contribute independently to ovarian and breast
	pathogenesis when overexpressed because of genomic abnormalities.
	They also suggest that PVT1-mediated inhibition of apoptosis may
	explain why amplification of 8q24 is associated with reduced survival
	duration in patients treated with agents that act through apoptotic
	mechanisms.},

	which is a plausible scenario for many complex diseases. We show
	that simultaneous analysis of the entire set of SNPs from a genome-wide
	study to identify the subset that best predicts disease outcome is
	now feasible, thanks to developments in stochastic search methods.
	We used a Bayesian-inspired penalised maximum likelihood approach
	in which every SNP can be considered for additive, dominant, and
	recessive contributions to disease risk. Posterior mode estimates
	were obtained for regression coefficients that were each assigned
	a prior with a sharp mode at zero. A non-zero coefficient estimate
	was interpreted as corresponding to a significant SNP. We investigated
	two prior distributions and show that the normal-exponential-gamma
	prior leads to improved SNP selection in comparison with single-SNP
	tests. We also derived an explicit approximation for type-I error
	that avoids the need to use permutation procedures. As well as genome-wide
	analyses, our method is well-suited to fine mapping with very dense
	SNP sets obtained from re-sequencing and/or imputation. It can accommodate
	quantitative as well as case-control phenotypes, covariate adjustment,
	and can be extended to search for interactions. Here, we demonstrate
	the power and empirical type-I error of our approach using simulated
	case-control data sets of up to 500 K SNPs, a real genome-wide data

	sequencing is no longer the technology of choice for most ultra-high-throughput

  abstract = {This article addresses the problem of choosing weights for iterative
	weighted least squares estimation in heteroscedastic linear models.
	An asymptotically optimal method for determining weights at each
	iteration is derived under a Bayesian model for the variances. The
	method uses a compromise between model-based and model-free variance
	estimates. Consider a heteroscedastic linear regression model in
	which responses are grouped so that the variance is constant within
	each group. Let $\beta$ denote the vector of regression parameters
	and let $\theta$ denote a vector of parameters determining a prior
	distribution for the variances. Iterative weighted least squares
	estimators are defined as follows. Given estimates $\hat{\beta}$
	and $\hat{\theta}$, calculate a weight for the $i$th group as a function
	of $\hat{\theta}$, the values in the $i$th group of the predictor
	variables, and the average of the squared residuals from the estimated
	mean responses in the $i$th group. Given weights, calculate the weighted
	least squares estimate $\hat{\beta}$ and a new estimate $\hat{\theta}$.
	Continue until $\hat{\beta}$ converges. We derive the asymptotically
	optimal weight function under an inverse gamma model for the variances.
	The resulting weights have a simple form. At each iteration the inverse
	weight for the $i$th group is a weighted average of the average squared
	residual and a variance estimate based on the inverse gamma model.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: DNA copy number alterations are one of the main characteristics
	of the cancer cell karyotype and can contribute to the complex phenotype
	of these cells. These alterations can lead to gains in cellular oncogenes
	as well as losses in tumor suppressor genes and can span small intervals
	as well as involve entire chromosomes. The ability to accurately
	detect these changes is central to understanding how they impact
	the biology of the cell. RESULTS: We describe a novel algorithm called
	CARAT (Copy Number Analysis with Regression And Tree) that uses probe
	intensity information to infer copy number in an allele-specific
	manner from high density DNA oligonuceotide arrays designed to genotype
	over 100,000 SNPs. Total and allele-specific copy number estimations
	using CARAT are independently evaluated for a subset of SNPs using
	quantitative PCR and allelic TaqMan reactions with several human
	breast cancer cell lines. The sensitivity and specificity of the
	algorithm are characterized using DNA samples containing differing
	numbers of X chromosomes as well as a test set of normal individuals.
	Results from the algorithm show a high degree of agreement with results
	from independent verification methods. CONCLUSION: Overall, CARAT
	automatically detects regions with copy number variations and assigns
	a significance score to each alteration as well as generating allele-specific
	output. When coupled with SNP genotype calls from the same array,
	CARAT provides additional detail into the structure of genome wide
	alterations that can contribute to allelic imbalance.},

  abstract = {Changes in DNA copy number are one of the hallmarks of the genetic
	instability common to most human cancers. Previous microarray-based
	methods have been used to identify chromosomal gains and losses;
	however, they are unable to genotype alleles at the level of single
	nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Here we describe a novel algorithm
	that uses a recently developed high-density oligonucleotide array-based
	SNP genotyping method, whole genome sampling analysis (WGSA), to
	identify genome-wide chromosomal gains and losses at high resolution.
	WGSA simultaneously genotypes over 10,000 SNPs by allele-specific
	hybridisation to perfect match (PM) and mismatch (MM) probes synthesised
	on a single array. The copy number algorithm jointly uses PM intensity
	and discrimination ratios between paired PM and MM intensity values
	to identify and estimate genetic copy number changes. Values from
	an experimental sample are compared with SNP-specific distributions
	derived from a reference set containing over 100 normal individuals
	to gain statistical power. Genomic regions with statistically significant
	copy number changes can be identified using both single point analysis
	and contiguous point analysis of SNP intensities. We identified multiple
	regions of amplification and deletion using a panel of human breast
	cancer cell lines. We verified these results using an independent
	method based on quantitative polymerase chain reaction and found
	that our approach is both sensitive and specific and can tolerate
	samples which contain a mixture of both tumour and normal DNA. In
	addition, by using known allele frequencies from the reference set,
	statistically significant genomic intervals can be identified containing
	contiguous stretches of homozygous markers, potentially allowing
	the detection of regions undergoing loss of heterozygosity (LOH)
	without the need for a matched normal control sample. The coupling
	of LOH analysis, via SNP genotyping, with copy number estimations
	using a single array provides additional insight into the structure
	of genomic alterations. With mean and median inter-SNP euchromatin
	distances of 244 kilobases (kb) and 119 kb, respectively, this method
	affords a resolution that is not easily achievable with non-oligonucleotide-based
	experimental approaches.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: High throughput microarray-based single nucleotide polymorphism
	(SNP) genotyping has revolutionized the way genome-wide linkage scans
	and association analyses are performed. One of the key features of
	the array-based GeneChip Mapping 10K Array from Affymetrix is the
	automated SNP calling algorithm. The Affymetrix algorithm was trained
	on a database of ethnically diverse DNA samples to create SNP call
	zones that are used as static models to make genotype calls for experimental
	data. We describe here the implementation of clustering algorithms
	on large training datasets resulting in improved SNP call rates on
	the 10K GeneChip. RESULTS: A database of 948 individuals genotyped
	on the GeneChip Mapping 10K 2.0 Array was used to identify 822 SNPs
	that were called consistently less than 75\% of the time. These SNPs
	represent on average 8.25\% of the total SNPs on each chromosome
	with chromosome 19, the most gene-rich chromosome, containing the
	highest proportion of poor performers (18.7\%). To remedy this, we
	created SNiPer, a new application which uses two clustering algorithms
	to yield increased call rates and equivalent concordance to Affymetrix
	called genotypes. We include a training set for these algorithms
	based on individual genotypes for 705 samples. SNiPer has the capability
	to be retrained for lab-specific training sets. SNiPer is freely
	available for download at http://www.tgen.org/neurogenomics/data.
	CONCLUSION: The correct calling of poor performing SNPs may prove
	to be key in future linkage studies performed on the 10K GeneChip.
	It would prove particularly invaluable for those diseases that map
	to chromosome 19, known to contain a high proportion of poorly performing
	SNPs. Our results illustrate that SNiPer can be used to increase
	call rates on the 10K GeneChip without sacrificing accuracy, thereby
	increasing the amount of valid data generated.},

	A webtool was made available for developers to benchmark their procedures.
	At the time of writing over 50 methods had been submitted. RESULTS:
	We benchmarked 31 probe set algorithms using a U95A dataset of spike
	in controls. Using this dataset, we found that background correction,
	one of the main steps in preprocessing, has the largest effect on
	performance. In particular, background correction appears to improve
	accuracy but, in general, worsen precision. The benchmark results
	put this balance in perspective. Furthermore, we have improved some
	of the original benchmark metrics to provide more detailed information
	regarding precision and accuracy. A handful of methods stand out
	as providing the best balance using spike-in data with the older
	U95A array, although different experiments on more current arrays
	may benchmark differently. AVAILABILITY: The affycomp package, now

	array data from the Affymetrix GeneChip system with the objective
	of improving upon currently used measures of gene expression. Our
	analyses make use of three data sets: a small experimental study
	consisting of 5 MGU74A mouse GeneChip arrays, part of the data from
	an extensive spike-in study conducted by Gene Logic andWyeth’s Genetics
	Institute involving 95 HG-U95A human GeneChip arrays; and part of
	a dilution study conducted by Gene Logic involving 75 HG-U95A GeneChip
	arrays. We display some familiar features of the perfect match and
	mismatch probe (PM and MM) values of these data, and examine the
	variance-mean relationship with probe-level data from probes believed
	to be defective, and so delivering noise only. We explain why we
	need to normalize the arrays to one another using probe level intensities.
	We then examine the behavior of the PM and MM using spike-in data
	and assess three commonly used summary measures: Affymetrix’s i)
	average difference (AvDiff) and ii) MAS 5.0 signal, and iii) the
	Li and Wong multiplicative model-based expression index (MBEI). The
	exploratory data analyses of the probe level data motivate a new
	summary measure that is a robust multi-array average (RMA) of background
	adjusted, normalized, and log transformed PM values. We evaluate
	the four expression summary measures using the dilution study data,
	assessing their behavior in terms of bias, variance and (for MBEI
	and RMA) model fit. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms in terms
	of their ability to detect known levels of differential expression
	using the spike-in data. We conclude that there is no obvious downside
	to using RMA and attaching a standard error (SE) to this quantity
	using a linear model which removes probe-specific affinities. An

	study of the degree to which probes with a given match type to a

	10 K Xba 142 2.0 Arrays. The availability of the HapMap data allowed
	us to validate the performance of 6843 SNPs for which we had both
	complete individual and pooled genotyping data. Pooled analyses averaged
	over 5-6 microarrays resulted in highly reproducible results. Moreover,
	the accuracy of estimating differences in allele frequency between
	pools using this ultra-high throughput system was comparable with
	previous reports of pooling based upon lower throughput platforms,
	with an average error for the predicted allelic frequencies differences
	between the two pools of 1.37\% and with 95\% of SNPs showing an
	error of < 3.2\%. CONCLUSION: Genotyping thousands of SNPs with DNA
	pooling using Affymetrix microarrays produces highly accurate results
	and can be used for genome-wide association studies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cervical carcinoma develops as a result of multiple genetic
	alterations. Different studies investigated genomic alterations in
	cervical cancer mainly by means of metaphase comparative genomic
	hybridization (mCGH) and microsatellite marker analysis for the detection
	of loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Currently, high throughput methods
	such as array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH), single
	nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP array) and gene expression arrays
	are available to study genome-wide alterations. Integration of these
	3 platforms allows detection of genomic alterations at high resolution
	and investigation of an association between copy number changes and
	expression. RESULTS: Genome-wide copy number and genotype analysis
	of 10 cervical cancer cell lines by array CGH and SNP array showed
	highly complex large-scale alterations. A comparison between array
	CGH and SNP array revealed that the overall concordance in detection
	of the same areas with copy number alterations (CNA) was above 90\%.
	The use of SNP arrays demonstrated that about 75\% of LOH events
	would not have been found by methods which screen for copy number
	changes, such as array CGH, since these were LOH events without CNA.
	Regions frequently targeted by CNA, as determined by array CGH, such
	as amplification of 5p and 20q, and loss of 8p were confirmed by
	fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Genome-wide, we did not
	find a correlation between copy-number and gene expression. At chromosome
	arm 5p however, 22\% of the genes were significantly upregulated
	in cell lines with amplifications as compared to cell lines without
	amplifications, as measured by gene expression arrays. For 3 genes,
	SKP2, ANKH and TRIO, expression differences were confirmed by quantitative
	real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). CONCLUSION: This study showed that copy
	number data retrieved from either array CGH or SNP array are comparable
	and that the integration of genome-wide LOH, copy number and gene
	expression is useful for the identification of gene specific targets
	that could be relevant for the development and progression in cervical
	cancer.},

	demonstrated a >90\% verification rate. The use of high-resolution

	Our approach is based upon a generalized linear model that takes
	advantage of a novel classification of probes on the array. As a
	result of this classification, we are able to fit the model to the

	with very high accuracy. Moreover, we are able to provide a generalized
	genotype in cancer samples (e.g. CCCCT at an amplified SNP). Our
	approach is illustrated on a variety of lung cancer cell lines and
	tumors, and a number of events are validated by independent computational
	and experimental means. An R software package containing the methods

	are hallmarks of cancer. In recent years a variety of studies have
	emerged measuring total chromosomal copy number at increasingly high
	resolution. Similarly, loss-of-heterozygosity events have been finely
	mapped using high-throughput genotyping technologies. We have developed
	a probe-level allele-specific quantitation procedure that extracts
	both copy number and allelotype information from single nucleotide
	polymorphism (SNP) array data to arrive at allele-specific copy number
	across the genome. Our approach applies an expectation-maximization
	algorithm to a model derived from a novel classification of SNP array
	probes. This method is the first to our knowledge that is able to
	(a) determine the generalized genotype of aberrant samples at each
	SNP site (e.g., CCCCT at an amplified site), and (b) infer the copy
	number of each parental chromosome across the genome. With this method,
	we are able to determine not just where amplifications and deletions
	occur, but also the haplotype of the region being amplified or deleted.
	The merit of our model and general approach is demonstrated by very
	precise genotyping of normal samples, and our allele-specific copy
	number inferences are validated using PCR experiments. Applying our
	method to a collection of lung cancer samples, we are able to conclude
	that amplification is essentially monoallelic, as would be expected
	under the mechanisms currently believed responsible for gene amplification.
	This suggests that a specific parental chromosome may be targeted
	for amplification, whether because of germ line or somatic variation.

	genomic hybridization (CGH) data is important for characterizing
	the cancer genome. An important part of this process is the segmentation
	of the log-ratios between the sample and control DNA along the chromosome

	are available in the literature for this procedure and the results
	can vary substantially among these. Thus, a visualization tool that
	can display the segmented profiles from a number of methods can be
	helpful to the biologist or the clinician to ascertain that a feature
	of interest did not arise as an artifact of the algorithm. Such a
	tool also allows the methodologist to easily contrast his method
	against others. We developed a web-based tool that applies a number
	of popular algorithms to a single array CGH profile entered by the
	user. It generates a heatmap panel of the segmented profiles for
	each method as well as a consensus profile. The clickable heatmap
	can be moved along the chromosome and zoomed in or out. It also displays
	the time that each algorithm took and provides numerical values of
	the segmented profiles for download. The web interface calls algorithms

	The latter point allows us to annotate SNPs that have poor performance,

	Generally, our method agrees well with a method developed by Affymetrix.

	problem. The interplay between biophysics, bioinformatics and mining
	of GeneChip surveys is leading to new insights into how best to analyse
	the data. Many of the molecular processes occurring on the surfaces
	of GeneChips result from the high surface density of probes. Interactions
	between neighbouring adjacent probes affect their rate and strength
	of hybridization to targets. Competing targets may hybridize to the
	same probe, and targets may partially bind to more than one probe.
	The formation of these partial hybrids results in a number of probes
	not reaching thermodynamic equilibrium during hybridization. Moreover,
	some targets fold up, or cross-hybridize to other targets. Furthermore,
	probes may fold and can undergo chemical saturation. There are also
	sequence-dependent differences in the rates of target desorption
	during the washing stage. Improvements in the mappings between probe
	sequence and biological databases are leading to more accurate gene
	expression profiles. Moreover, algorithms that combine the intensities
	of multiple probes into single measures of expression are increasingly
	dependent upon models of the hybridization processes occurring on
	GeneChips. The large repositories of GeneChip data can be searched
	for systematic effects across many experiments. This data mining
	has led to the discovery of a family of thousands of probes, which
	show correlated expression across thousands of GeneChip experiments.

	of the probes to transcript concentration. In an effort to address
	the nonspecific response of probes, Affymetrix GeneChip arrays use
	two probes for each measurement. One of these probes, the mismatch
	(MM) probe, is intended to reflect the nonspecific response of the
	corresponding perfect match (PM) probe. However, the reliability
	of this approach has not been established by published experiments.
	Indeed, some research has shown that at high transcript concentrations,
	the nonspecific component of the PM signal is a negligible part of
	the MM signal. Five variations of a method to model and estimate
	levels of gene expression on Affymetrix chips, without the use of

	using each of the five algorithms bore a strong linear relationship

	The five variations were applied to a Latin square data set and the

	Most studies so far have focused on how a CNA affects the expression

	are computed over multiple patients that have both expression and
	copy number measurements in brain, bladder, and breast cancer data

	identify a set of CNAs that is coordinately associated with the expression
	changes of a set of genes, we used a biclustering algorithm on the

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most common
	genetic variations in the human genome and are useful as genomic
	markers. Oligonucleotide SNP microarrays have been developed for
	high-throughput genotyping of up to 900,000 human SNPs and have been
	used widely in linkage and cancer genomics studies. We have previously
	used Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to analyze SNP array data for inferring
	copy numbers and loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) from paired normal
	and tumor samples and unpaired tumor samples. RESULTS: We proposed
	and implemented major copy proportion (MCP) analysis of oligonucleotide
	SNP array data. A HMM was constructed to infer unobserved MCP states
	from observed allele-specific signals through emission and transition
	distributions. We used 10 K, 100 K and 250 K SNP array datasets to
	compare MCP analysis with LOH and copy number analysis, and showed
	that MCP performs better than LOH analysis for allelic-imbalanced
	chromosome regions and normal contaminated samples. The major and
	minor copy alleles can also be inferred from allelic-imbalanced regions
	by MCP analysis. CONCLUSION: MCP extends tumor LOH analysis to allelic
	imbalance analysis and supplies complementary information to total
	copy numbers. MCP analysis of mixing normal and tumor samples suggests
	the utility of MCP analysis of normal-contaminated tumor samples.
	The described analysis and visualization methods are readily available
	in the user-friendly dChip software.},

	an optimal scanning procedure. RESULTS: All scanners showed a limited

	the expression ratios were independent of PMT voltage. This usable
	intensity range was considerably less than the maximum detection
	range of the PMTs. The use of spot and background intensities outside
	this range led to errors in the ratios. The errors at high intensities
	were caused by saturation of pixel intensities within the spots.
	An algorithm was developed to correct the intensities of these spots,
	and, hence, extend the upper limit of the usable intensity range.
	CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that the PMT voltage should be increased
	to avoid intensities of the weakest spots below the usable range,
	allowing the brightest spots to reach the level of saturation. Subsequently,
	a second set of images should be acquired with a lower PMT setting
	such that no pixels are in saturation. Reliable data for spots with
	saturation in the first set of images can easily be extracted from
	the second set of images by the use of our algorithm. This procedure
	would lead to an increase in the accuracy of the data and in the
	number of data points achieved in each experiment compared to traditional
	procedures.},

	Neyman and Scott (1948) had demonstrated that maximum likelihood

	covariance matrix of the MLE is not equal to the inverse of the information

	(which include in particular the MLE) obtained via the usual likelihood
	approach when the incidental parameters are first replaced by their
	estimates (which are allowed to depend on the structural parameters).
	Conditions for consistency and asymptotic normality together with
	a proper formula for the asymptotic covariance matrix are given.
	The results are illustrated and applied to the problem of estimating
	linear functional relationships, and mild conditions on the incidental
	parameters for the MLE (or an adjusted MLE) to be consistent and
	asymptotically normal are obtained. These conditions are weaker than
	those imposed by previous authors.},

	Therefore, we wanted to know whether the performance of the dendrimer
	method is comparable to the other methods, or whether significant

	controlled for the effects of print-tip and background subtraction
	biases. We also performed a smaller study, namely, a dilution series
	study with five dilution points per labeling method, to evaluate
	one aspect of predictive ability. From the replicate study, the dendrimer
	method appeared to perform as well, and often better, with respect
	to reproducibility and ability to detect expression. However, in
	the dilution series study, this method was outperformed by the other
	two in terms of predictive ability and did not perform very well.

	This paper deals with the robust estimation of the location vector

	defined as solutions of the system: $\sum_i u_1(d_i)(\mathbf{x}_i

	Existence and uniqueness of solutions of this system are proved under
	general assumptions about the functions $u_1$ and $u_2$. Then the

	The breakdown bound and the influence function are calculated, showing

	identified in some individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD),
	but the full etiologic role is unknown. We performed genome-wide
	assessment for structural abnormalities in 427 unrelated ASD cases
	via single-nucleotide polymorphism microarrays and karyotyping. With
	microarrays, we discovered 277 unbalanced CNVs in 44\% of ASD families
	not present in 500 controls (and re-examined in another 1152 controls).
	Karyotyping detected additional balanced changes. Although most variants
	were inherited, we found a total of 27 cases with de novo alterations,
	and in three (11\%) of these individuals, two or more new variants
	were observed. De novo CNVs were found in approximately 7\% and approximately
	2\% of idiopathic families having one child, or two or more ASD siblings,
	respectively. We also detected 13 loci with recurrent/overlapping
	CNV in unrelated cases, and at these sites, deletions and duplications
	affecting the same gene(s) in different individuals and sometimes
	in asymptomatic carriers were also found. Notwithstanding complexities,

	algorithm for Affymetrix and Nimblegen gene-expression microarrays.
	RMA performs background correction, normalization, and summarization
	in a modular way. The last two steps require multiple arrays to be
	analyzed simultaneously. The ability to borrow information across
	samples provides RMA various advantages. For example, the summarization
	step fits a parametric model that accounts for probe-effects, assumed
	to be fixed across arrays, and improves outlier detection. Residuals,
	obtained from the fitted model, permit the creation of useful quality
	metrics. However, the dependence on multiple arrays has two drawbacks:
	(1) RMA can- not be used in clinical settings where samples must
	be processed individu- ally or in small batches and (2) data sets
	preprocessed separately are not comparable. We propose a preprocessing
	algorithm, frozen RMA (fRMA), which allows one to analyze microarrays
	individually or in small batches and then combine the data for analysis.
	This is accomplished by utilizing information from the large publicly
	available microarray databases. In particular, estimates of probe-specific
	effects and variances are precomputed and frozen. Then, with new
	data sets, these are used in concert with information from the new
	array(s) to normalize and summarize the data. We find that fRMA is
	comparable to RMA when the data are analyzed as a single batch and
	outperforms RMA when analyzing multiple batches. The methods described
	here are implemented in the R package frma and are currently available
	for download from the software section of http://rafalab.jhsph.edu},

	can be effectively used in this way to perform chromatin immunoprecipitation
	(ChIP) on chip as an alternative to tiling microarrays. We illustrate
	this novel application by mapping whole genome histone H4 hyperacetylation
	in human myoblasts and myotubes. We detect clusters of hyperacetylated
	histone H4, often spanning across up to 300 kilobases of genomic
	sequence. Using complementary genome-wide analyses of gene expression
	by DNA microarray we demonstrate that these clusters of hyperacetylated
	histone H4 tend to be associated with expressed genes. CONCLUSION:
	The use of a SNP array for a ChIP-on-chip application (ChIP on SNP-chip)
	will be of great value to laboratories whose interest is the determination
	of general rules regarding the relationship of specific chromatin
	modifications to transcriptional status throughout the genome and

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The biomedical community is developing new methods of
	data analysis to more efficiently process the massive data sets produced
	by microarray experiments. Systematic and global mathematical approaches
	that can be readily applied to a large number of experimental designs
	become fundamental to correctly handle the otherwise overwhelming
	data sets. RESULTS: The gene selection model presented herein is
	based on the observation that: (1) variance of gene expression is
	a function of absolute expression; (2) one can model this relationship
	in order to set an appropriate lower fold change limit of significance;
	and (3) this relationship defines a function that can be used to
	select differentially expressed genes. The model first evaluates
	fold change (FC) across the entire range of absolute expression levels
	for any number of experimental conditions. Genes are systematically
	binned, and those genes within the top X\% of highest FCs for each
	bin are evaluated both with and without the use of replicates. A
	function is fitted through the top X\% of each bin, thereby defining
	a limit fold change. All genes selected by the 5\% FC model lie above
	measurement variability using a within standard deviation (SDwithin)
	confidence level of 99.9\%. Real time-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis demonstrated
	85.7\% concordance with microarray data selected by the limit function.
	CONCLUSION: The FC model can confidently select differentially expressed
	genes as corroborated by variance data and RT-PCR. The simplicity
	of the overall process permits selecting model limits that best describe
	experimental data by extracting information on gene expression patterns
	across the range of expression levels. Genes selected by this process
	can be consistently compared between experiments and enables the
	user to globally extract information with a high degree of confidence.},

	DNA/DNA and RNA/DNA oligonucleotide-duplexes: comparison of single
	base mismatches and base bulges.},
  journal = {BMC Biotechnol},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {8},
  pages = {48},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The high binding specificity of short 10 to 30 mer oligonucleotide
	probes enables single base mismatch (MM) discrimination and thus
	provides the basis for genotyping and resequencing microarray applications.
	Recent experiments indicate that the underlying principles governing
	DNA microarray hybridization - and in particular MM discrimination
	- are not completely understood. Microarrays usually address complex
	mixtures of DNA targets. In order to reduce the level of complexity
	and to study the problem of surface-based hybridization with point
	defects in more detail, we performed array based hybridization experiments
	in well controlled and simple situations. RESULTS: We performed microarray
	hybridization experiments with short 16 to 40 mer target and probe
	lengths (in situations without competitive hybridization) in order
	to systematically investigate the impact of point-mutations - varying
	defect type and position - on the oligonucleotide duplex binding
	affinity. The influence of single base bulges and single base MMs
	depends predominantly on position - it is largest in the middle of
	the strand. The position-dependent influence of base bulges is very
	similar to that of single base MMs, however certain bulges give rise
	to an unexpectedly high binding affinity. Besides the defect (MM
	or bulge) type, which is the second contribution in importance to
	hybridization affinity, there is also a sequence dependence, which
	extends beyond the defect next-neighbor and which is difficult to
	quantify. Direct comparison between binding affinities of DNA/DNA
	and RNA/DNA duplexes shows, that RNA/DNA purine-purine MMs are more
	discriminating than corresponding DNA/DNA MMs. In DNA/DNA MM discrimination
	the affected base pair (C.G vs. A.T) is the pertinent parameter.
	We attribute these differences to the different structures of the
	duplexes (A vs. B form). CONCLUSION: We have shown that DNA microarrays
	can resolve even subtle changes in hybridization affinity for simple
	target mixtures. We have further shown that the impact of point defects
	on oligonucleotide stability can be broken down to a hierarchy of
	effects. In order to explain our observations we propose DNA molecular
	dynamics - in form of zipping of the oligonucleotide duplex - to
	play an important role.},

  abstract = {We have developed a robust algorithm for copy number analysis of the
	human genome using high-density oligonucleotide microarrays containing
	116,204 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. The advantages of this algorithm
	include the improvement of signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios and the use
	of an optimized reference. The raw S/N ratios were improved by accounting
	for the length and GC content of the PCR products using quadratic
	regressions. The use of constitutional DNA, when available, gives
	the lowest SD values (0.16 +/- 0.03) and also enables allele-based
	copy number detection in cancer genomes, which can unmask otherwise
	concealed allelic imbalances. In the absence of constitutional DNA,
	optimized selection of multiple normal references with the highest
	S/N ratios, in combination with the data regressions, dramatically
	improves SD values from 0.67 +/- 0.12 to 0.18 +/- 0.03. These improvements
	allow for highly reliable comparison of data across different experimental
	conditions, detection of allele-based copy number changes, and more
	accurate estimations of the range and magnitude of copy number aberrations.
	This algorithm has been implemented in a software package called
	Copy Number Analyzer for Affymetrix GeneChip Mapping 100K arrays

  title = {Spatial normalization of array-{CGH} data.},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {7},
  pages = {264},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH)
	is a recently developed technique for analyzing changes in DNA copy
	number. As in all microarray analyses, normalization is required
	to correct for experimental artifacts while preserving the true biological
	signal. We investigated various sources of systematic variation in
	array-CGH data and identified two distinct types of spatial effect
	of no biological relevance as the predominant experimental artifacts:
	continuous spatial gradients and local spatial bias. Local spatial
	bias affects a large proportion of arrays, and has not previously
	been considered in array-CGH experiments. RESULTS: We show that existing
	normalization techniques do not correct these spatial effects properly.
	We therefore developed an automatic method for the spatial normalization
	of array-CGH data. This method makes it possible to delineate and
	to eliminate and/or correct areas affected by spatial bias. It is
	based on the combination of a spatial segmentation algorithm called
	NEM (Neighborhood Expectation Maximization) and spatial trend estimation.
	We defined quality criteria for array-CGH data, demonstrating significant
	improvements in data quality with our method for three data sets
	coming from two different platforms (198, 175 and 26 BAC-arrays).
	CONCLUSION: We have designed an automatic algorithm for the spatial
	normalization of BAC CGH-array data, preventing the misinterpretation
	of experimental artifacts as biologically relevant outliers in the
	genomic profile. This algorithm is implemented in the R package MANOR
	(Micro-Array NORmalization), which is described at http://bioinfo.curie.fr/projects/manor

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Skin cancer accounts for 1/3 of all newly diagnosed cancer.
	Although seldom fatal, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is associated with
	severe disfigurement and morbidity. BCC has a unique interest for
	researchers, as although it is often locally invasive, it rarely
	metastasises. This paper, reporting the first whole genome expression
	microarray analysis of skin cancer, aimed to investigate the molecular
	profile of BCC in comparison to non-cancerous skin biopsies. RNA
	from BCC and normal skin specimens was analysed using Affymetrix
	whole genome microarrays. A Welch t-test was applied to data normalised
	using dCHIP to identify significant differentially-expressed genes
	between BCC and normal specimens. Principal component analysis and
	support vector machine analysis were performed on resulting genelists,
	Genmapp was used to identify pathways affected, and GOstat aided
	identification of areas of gene ontology more highly represented
	on these lists than would be expected by chance. RESULTS: Following
	normalisation, specimens clustered into groups of BCC specimens and
	of normal skin specimens. Of the 54,675 gene transcripts/variants
	analysed, 3,921 were differentially expressed between BCC and normal
	skin specimens. Of these, 2,108 were significantly up-regulated and
	1,813 were statistically significantly down-regulated in BCCs. CONCLUSION:
	Functional gene sets differentially expressed include those involved
	in transcription, proliferation, cell motility, apoptosis and metabolism.
	As expected, members of the Wnt and hedgehog pathways were found
	to be significantly different between BCC and normal specimens, as
	were many previously undescribed changes in gene expression between
	normal and BCC specimens, including basonuclin2 and mrp9. Quantitative-PCR
	analysis confirmed our microarray results, identifying novel potential

	have been used, both in the implementation of this technology and
	in the analysis of the large amount of expression data. However,
	several practical issues still have not been resolved in a satisfactory
	manner, and among the most critical is the lack of agreement in the
	results obtained in different array platforms. In this study, we
	present a comparison of several microarray platforms [Affymetrix
	oligonucleotide arrays, custom complementary DNA (cDNA) arrays, and
	custom oligo arrays printed with oligonucleotides from three different
	sources] as well as analysis of various methods used for microarray
	target preparation and the reference design. The results indicate
	that the pairwise correlations of expression levels between platforms
	are relative low overall but that the log ratios of the highly expressed
	genes are strongly correlated, especially between Affymetrix and
	cDNA arrays. The microarray measurements were compared with quantitative
	real-time-polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) results for 23 genes,
	and the varying degrees of agreement for each platform were characterized.
	We have also developed and tested a double amplification method which
	allows the use of smaller amounts of starting material. The added
	round of amplification produced reproducible results as compared
	to the arrays hybridized with single round amplified targets. Finally,
	the reliability of using a universal RNA reference for two-channel

	The introduction of high-density SNP genotyping technology to genomic
	profiling, termed SNP-CGH, represents a further advance, since simultaneous
	measurement of both signal intensity variations and changes in allelic
	composition makes it possible to detect both copy number changes
	and copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) events. We demonstrate
	the utility of SNP-CGH with two Infinium whole-genome genotyping
	BeadChips, assaying 109,000 and 317,000 SNP loci, to detect chromosomal
	aberrations in samples bearing constitutional aberrations as well
	tumor samples at sub-100 kb effective resolution. Detected aberrations
	include homozygous deletions, hemizygous deletions, copy-neutral
	LOH, duplications, and amplifications. The statistical ability to
	detect common aberrations was modeled by analysis of an X chromosome
	titration model system, and sensitivity was modeled by titration
	of gDNA from a tumor cell with that of its paired normal cell line.
	Analysis was facilitated by using a genome browser that plots log
	ratios of normalized intensities and allelic ratios along the chromosomes.
	We developed two modes of SNP-CGH analysis, a single sample and a
	paired sample mode. The single sample mode computes log intensity
	ratios and allelic ratios by referencing to canonical genotype clusters
	generated from approximately 120 reference samples, whereas the paired
	sample mode uses a paired normal reference sample from the same individual.
	Finally, the two analysis modes are compared and contrasted for their
	utility in analyzing different types of input gDNA: low input amounts,
	fragmented gDNA, and Phi29 whole-genome pre-amplified DNA.},

  abstract = {Background: Microarray-CGH experiments are used to detect and map
	chromosomal
	
	imbalances, by hybridizing targets of genomic DNA from a test and
	a reference sample to
	
	sequences immobilized on a slide. These probes are genomic DNA sequences
	(BACs) that are
	
	mapped on the genome. The signal has a spatial coherence that can
	be handled by specific statistical
	
	tools. Segmentation methods seem to be a natural framework for this
	purpose. A CGH profile can
	
	be viewed as a succession of segments that represent homogeneous regions
	in the genome whose
	
	BACs share the same relative copy number on average. We model a CGH
	profile by a random
	
	Gaussian process whose distribution parameters are affected by abrupt
	changes at unknown
	
	coordinates. Two major problems arise : to determine which parameters
	are affected by the abrupt
	
	changes (the mean and the variance, or the mean only), and the selection
	of the number of
	
	segments in the profile.
	
	
	Results: We demonstrate that existing methods for estimating the number
	of segments are not
	
	well adapted in the case of array CGH data, and we propose an adaptive
	criterion that detects
	
	previously mapped chromosomal aberrations. The performances of this
	method are discussed
	
	based on simulations and publicly available data sets. Then we discuss
	the choice of modeling for
	
	array CGH data and show that the model with a homogeneous variance
	is adapted to this context.
	
	
	Conclusions: Array CGH data analysis is an emerging field that needs
	appropriate statistical tools.
	
	Process segmentation and model selection provide a theoretical framework
	that allows precise
	
	biological interpretations. Adaptive methods for model selection give
	promising results concerning
	
	the estimation of the number of altered regions on the genome.},

	of color signals from fluorescent dyes. A common problem is that
	a given scanning intensity is not usually optimal for all spotted

	in poor separation of signals from different tissues or conditions.
	The problem may be addressed by multiple scans with varying scanning
	intensities. Multiple scanning intensities raise the question of
	how to combine different signals from the same spot, particularly
	when measurement error is not negligible. RESULTS: This paper suggests
	a non-linear latent regression model for this purpose. It corrects
	for biases caused by the saturation limit and efficiently combines
	data from multiple scans. Combining multiple scans also allows reduction
	of technical error particularly for cDNA spots with low signal. The
	procedure is exemplified using cDNA expression data from maize. AVAILABILITY:

  abstract = {Gene dosage variations occur in many diseases. In cancer, deletions
	and copy number increases contribute to alterations in the expression
	of tumour-suppressor genes and oncogenes, respectively. Developmental
	abnormalities, such as Down, Prader Willi, Angelman and Cri du Chat
	syndromes, result from gain or loss of one copy of a chromosome or
	chromosomal region. Thus, detection and mapping of copy number abnormalities
	provide an approach for associating aberrations with disease phenotype
	and for localizing critical genes. Comparative genomic hybridization
	(CGH) was developed for genome-wide analysis of DNA sequence copy
	number in a single experiment. In CGH, differentially labelled total
	genomic DNA from a 'test' and a 'reference' cell population are cohybridized
	to normal metaphase chromosomes, using blocking DNA to suppress signals
	from repetitive sequences. The resulting ratio of the fluorescence
	intensities at a location on the 'cytogenetic map', provided by the
	chromosomes, is approximately proportional to the ratio of the copy
	numbers of the corresponding DNA sequences in the test and reference
	genomes. CGH has been broadly applied to human and mouse malignancies.
	The use of metaphase chromosomes, however, limits detection of events
	involving small regions (of less than 20 Mb) of the genome, resolution
	of closely spaced aberrations and linking ratio changes to genomic/genetic
	markers. Therefore, more laborious locus-by-locus techniques have
	been required for higher resolution studies. Hybridization to an
	array of mapped sequences instead of metaphase chromosomes could
	overcome the limitations of conventional CGH (ref. 6) if adequate
	performance could be achieved. Copy number would be related to the
	test/reference fluorescence ratio on the array targets, and genomic
	resolution could be determined by the map distance between the targets,
	or by the length of the cloned DNA segments. We describe here our
	implementation of array CGH. We demonstrate its ability to measure
	copy number with high precision in the human genome, and to analyse
	clinical specimens by obtaining new information on chromosome 20
	aberrations in breast cancer.},

  abstract = {Copy-number variation (CNV) is the most prevalent type of structural
	variation in the human genome, and contributes significantly to genetic
	heterogeneity. It has already been recognized that some CNVs can
	contribute to human phenotype, including rare genomic disorders and
	Mendelian diseases. Other CNVs are now amenable to genome-wide association
	studies so that their influence on human phenotypic diversity and
	disease susceptibility may soon be more readily determined. Population
	studies and reference databases for control and disease-associated
	samples are required to provide an information resource about CNV
	frequencies and their relative contribution to phenotypic outcomes.
	The relatively high cost of screening individual samples has tended
	to limit the number of controls assayed, and use of the data has
	often been hampered by the variety of technology platforms and analysis
	techniques. As a result, there is still a paucity of data on population
	frequency and distribution of CNVs, particularly for those that are

	low-level processing of oligonucleotide array data. The choice of
	technique has profound effect on subsequent statistical analyses,
	but there is no method to assess whether a particular technique is
	appropriate for a specific data set, without reference to external
	data. RESULTS: We analyzed coregulation between genes in order to
	detect insufficient normalization between arrays, where coregulation
	is measured in terms of statistical correlation. In a large collection
	of genes, a random pair of genes should have on average zero correlation,
	hence allowing a correlation test. For all data sets that we evaluated,
	and the three most commonly used low-level processing procedures
	including MAS5, RMA and MBEI, the housekeeping-gene normalization
	failed the test. For a real clinical data set, RMA and MBEI showed
	significant correlation for absent genes. We also found that a second
	round of normalization on the probe set level improved normalization
	significantly throughout. CONCLUSION: Previous evaluation of low-level
	processing in the literature has been limited to artificial spike-in
	and mixture data sets. In the absence of a known gold-standard, the
	correlation criterion allows us to assess the appropriateness of
	low-level processing of a specific data set and the success of normalization
	for subsets of genes.},

	for analysis of CNVs in small samples such as microdissected tissues

	ends and GC content. Pair-wise comparison of amplified products considerably
	reduced the number of apparent artifacts and partially restored the

  journal = BMCBioinfo,

  pages = {23},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are currently many different methods for processing
	and summarizing probe-level data from Affymetrix oligonucleotide
	arrays. It is of great interest to validate these methods and identify
	those that are most effective. There is no single best way to do
	this validation, and a variety of approaches is needed. Moreover,
	gene expression data are collected to answer a variety of scientific
	questions, and the same method may not be best for all questions.
	Only a handful of validation studies have been done so far, most
	of which rely on spike-in datasets and focus on the question of detecting
	differential expression. Here we seek methods that excel at estimating
	relative expression. We evaluate methods by identifying those that
	give the strongest linear association between expression measurements
	by array and the "gold-standard" assay. Quantitative reverse-transcription
	polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is generally considered the "gold-standard"
	assay for measuring gene expression by biologists and is often used
	to confirm findings from microarray data. Here we use qRT-PCR measurements
	to validate methods for the components of processing oligo array
	data: background adjustment, normalization, mismatch adjustment,
	and probeset summary. An advantage of our approach over spike-in
	studies is that methods are validated on a real dataset that was
	collected to address a scientific question. RESULTS: We initially
	identify three of six popular methods that consistently produced
	the best agreement between oligo array and RT-PCR data for medium-
	and high-intensity genes. The three methods are generally known as
	MAS5, gcRMA, and the dChip mismatch mode. For medium- and high-intensity
	genes, we identified use of data from mismatch probes (as in MAS5
	and dChip mismatch) and a sequence-based method of background adjustment
	(as in gcRMA) as the most important factors in methods' performances.
	However, we found poor reliability for methods using mismatch probes
	for low-intensity genes, which is in agreement with previous studies.
	CONCLUSION: We advocate use of sequence-based background adjustment
	in lieu of mismatch adjustment to achieve the best results across
	the intensity spectrum. No method of normalization or probeset summary
	showed any consistent advantages.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chromosomal imbalances are a major cause of developmental
	defects as well as cancer and often constitute the key in identification
	of novel disease related genes. Classical cytogenetic methods are
	limited in resolution and dependent on highly skilled labour, while
	methods with higher resolution, based on molecular cytogenetics approaches
	such as matrix CGH, are not widely available. METHODS: We have developed
	and evaluated a method we term "molecular karyotyping", using readily
	available and easy to handle oligonucleotide arrays originally designed
	for parallel genomewide analysis of over 10,000 SNPs. We show that
	we can easily and reliably detect unbalanced chromosomal aberrations
	of various sizes from as little as 250 ng of DNA on a single microarray,
	based on fluorescence intensity information from clusters of SNPs.
	RESULTS: We determined the resolution of this method through analysis
	of 20 trios with 21 previously confirmed subtle aberrations sizing
	between 0.2 and 13 Mb. Duplications and deletions of at least 5 Mb
	in size were reliably detectable, but detection of smaller aberrations
	was dependent on the number of SNPs they contained, thus seven of
	10 different deletions analysed, with sizes ranging from 0.2 to 3.7
	Mb, were not detectable due to insufficient SNP densitiy in the respective
	region. CONCLUSIONS: Deduction of reliable cut off levels for array
	peaks in our series of well characterised patients allows the use
	of the GeneChip Mapping 10K SNP array for performing rapid molecular
	karyotyping from small amounts of DNA for the detection of even subtle
	deletions and duplications with high sensitivity and specificity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quality-control is an important issue in the analysis
	of gene expression microarrays. One type of problem is regional bias,
	in which one region of a chip shows artifactually high or low intensities
	(or ratios in a two-channel array) relative to the majority of the
	chip. Current practice in quality assessment for microarrays does
	not address regional biases. RESULTS: We present methods implemented
	in R for visualizing regional biases and other spatial artifacts
	on spotted microarrays and Affymetrix chips. We also propose a statistical
	index to quantify regional bias and investigate its typical distribution
	on spotted and Affymetrix arrays. We demonstrate that notable regional
	biases occur on both Affymetrix and spotted arrays and that they
	can make a significant difference in the case of spotted microarray
	results. Although strong biases are also seen at the level of individual
	probes on Affymetrix chips, the gene expression measures are less
	affected, especially when the RMA method is used to summarize intensities
	for the probe sets. A web application program for visualization and
	quantitation of regional bias is provided at http://www.discover.nci.nih.gov/affytools.
	CONCLUSION: Researchers should visualize and measure the regional
	biases and should estimate their impact on gene expression measurements
	obtained. Here, we (i) introduce pictorial visualizations of the
	spatial biases; (ii) present for Affymetrix chips a useful resolution
	of the biases into two components, one related to background, the
	other to intensity scale factor; (iii) introduce a single parameter
	to reflect the global bias present across an array. We also examine
	the pattern distribution of such biases and conclude that algorithms
	based on smoothing are unlikely to compensate adequately for them.},

	copy number measurement of 11 000-500 000 SNPs along the genome.
	Their high density facilitates the precise localization of genomic

	it is influenced by non-relevant sources of variation, requiring
	correction. Moreover, the amplitude of variation induced by non-relevant

	(i.e. true copy number), making it difficult to estimate non-relevant
	effects accurately without including the biologically relevant effect.
	RESULTS: We addressed this problem by developing ITALICS, a normalization
	method that estimates both biological and non-relevant effects in
	an alternate, iterative manner, accurately eliminating irrelevant
	effects. We compared our normalization method with other existing
	and available methods, and found that ITALICS outperformed these

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Affymetrix GeneChips are an important tool in many facets
	of biological research. Recently, notable design changes to the chips
	have been made. In this study, we use publicly available data from
	Affymetrix to gauge the performance of three human gene expression
	arrays: Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 (U133), Human Exon 1.0 ST (HuEx)
	and Human Gene 1.0 ST (HuGene). RESULTS: We studied probe-, exon-
	and gene-level reproducibility of technical and biological replicates
	from each of the 3 platforms. The U133 array has larger feature sizes
	so it is no surprise that probe-level variances are smaller, however
	the larger number of probes per gene on the HuGene array seems to
	produce gene-level summaries that have similar variances. The gene-level
	summaries of the HuEx array are less reproducible than the other
	two, despite having the largest average number of probes per gene.
	Greater than 80\% of the content on the HuEx arrays is expressed
	at or near background. Biological variation seems to have a smaller
	effect on U133 data. Comparing the overlap of differentially expressed
	genes, we see a high overall concordance among all 3 platforms, with
	HuEx and HuGene having greater overlap, as expected given their design.
	We performed an analysis of detection rates and area under ROC curves
	using an experiment made up of several mixtures of 2 human tissues.
	Though it appears that the HuEx array has worse performance in terms
	of detection rates, all arrays have similar ability to separate differentially
	expressed and non-differentially expressed genes. CONCLUSION: Despite
	noticeable differences in the probe-level reproducibility, gene-level
	reproducibility and differential expression detection are quite similar
	across the three platforms. The HuEx array, an all-encompassing array,
	has the flexibility of measuring all known or predicted exonic content.
	However, the HuEx array induces poorer reproducibility for genes
	with fewer exons. The HuGene measures just the well-annotated genome
	content and appears to perform well. The U133 array, though not able
	to measure across the full length of a transcript, appears to perform
	as well as the newer designs on the set of genes common to all 3
	platforms.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recently, a large number of methods for the analysis of
	microarray data have been proposed but there are few comparisons
	of their relative performances. By using so-called spike-in experiments,
	it is possible to characterize the analyzed data and thereby enable
	comparisons of different analysis methods. RESULTS: A spike-in experiment
	using eight in-house produced arrays was used to evaluate established
	and novel methods for filtration, background adjustment, scanning,
	channel adjustment, and censoring. The S-plus package EDMA, a stand-alone
	tool providing characterization of analyzed cDNA-microarray data
	obtained from spike-in experiments, was developed and used to evaluate
	252 normalization methods. For all analyses, the sensitivities at
	low false positive rates were observed together with estimates of
	the overall bias and the standard deviation. In general, there was
	a trade-off between the ability of the analyses to identify differentially
	expressed genes (i.e. the analyses' sensitivities) and their ability
	to provide unbiased estimators of the desired ratios. Virtually all
	analysis underestimated the magnitude of the regulations; often less
	than 50\% of the true regulations were observed. Moreover, the bias
	depended on the underlying mRNA-concentration; low concentration
	resulted in high bias. Many of the analyses had relatively low sensitivities,
	but analyses that used either the constrained model (i.e. a procedure
	that combines data from several scans) or partial filtration (a novel
	method for treating data from so-called not-found spots) had with
	few exceptions high sensitivities. These methods gave considerable
	higher sensitivities than some commonly used analysis methods. CONCLUSION:
	The use of spike-in experiments is a powerful approach for evaluating
	microarray preprocessing procedures. Analyzed data are characterized
	by properties of the observed log-ratios and the analysis' ability
	to detect differentially expressed genes. If bias is not a major
	problem; we recommend the use of either the CM-procedure or partial
	filtration.},

  journal = {BMC Genet},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {9},
  pages = {27},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: DNA sequence diversity within the human genome may be
	more greatly affected by copy number variations (CNVs) than single
	nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Although the importance of CNVs
	in genome wide association studies (GWAS) is becoming widely accepted,
	the optimal methods for identifying these variants are still under
	evaluation. We have previously reported a comprehensive view of CNVs
	in the HapMap DNA collection using high density 500 K EA (Early Access)
	SNP genotyping arrays which revealed greater than 1,000 CNVs ranging
	in size from 1 kb to over 3 Mb. Although the arrays used most commonly
	for GWAS predominantly interrogate SNPs, CNV identification and detection
	does not necessarily require the use of DNA probes centered on polymorphic
	nucleotides and may even be hindered by the dependence on a successful
	SNP genotyping assay. RESULTS: In this study, we have designed and
	evaluated a high density array predicated on the use of non-polymorphic
	oligonucleotide probes for CNV detection. This approach effectively
	uncouples copy number detection from SNP genotyping and thus has
	the potential to significantly improve probe coverage for genome-wide
	CNV identification. This array, in conjunction with PCR-based, complexity-reduced
	DNA target, queries over 1.3 M independent NspI restriction enzyme
	fragments in the 200 bp to 1100 bp size range, which is a several
	fold increase in marker density as compared to the 500 K EA array.
	In addition, a novel algorithm was developed and validated to extract
	CNV regions and boundaries. CONCLUSION: Using a well-characterized
	pair of DNA samples, close to 200 CNVs were identified, of which
	nearly 50\% appear novel yet were independently validated using quantitative
	PCR. The results indicate that non-polymorphic probes provide a robust
	approach for CNV identification, and the increasing precision of
	CNV boundary delineation should allow a more complete analysis of
	their genomic organization.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microarray-based measurement of mRNA abundance assumes
	a linear relationship between the fluorescence intensity and the
	dye concentration. In reality, however, the calibration curve can
	be nonlinear. RESULTS: By scanning a microarray scanner calibration
	slide containing known concentrations of fluorescent dyes under 18
	PMT gains, we were able to evaluate the differences in calibration
	characteristics of Cy5 and Cy3. First, the calibration curve for
	the same dye under the same PMT gain is nonlinear at both the high
	and low intensity ends. Second, the degree of nonlinearity of the
	calibration curve depends on the PMT gain. Third, the two PMTs (for
	Cy5 and Cy3) behave differently even under the same gain. Fourth,
	the background intensity for the Cy3 channel is higher than that
	for the Cy5 channel. The impact of such characteristics on the accuracy
	and reproducibility of measured mRNA abundance and the calculated
	ratios was demonstrated. Combined with simulation results, we provided
	explanations to the existence of ratio underestimation, intensity-dependence
	of ratio bias, and anti-correlation of ratios in dye-swap replicates.
	We further demonstrated that although Lowess normalization effectively
	eliminates the intensity-dependence of ratio bias, the systematic
	deviation from true ratios largely remained. A method of calculating
	ratios based on concentrations estimated from the calibration curves
	was proposed for correcting ratio bias. CONCLUSION: It is preferable
	to scan microarray slides at fixed, optimal gain settings under which
	the linearity between concentration and intensity is maximized. Although
	normalization methods improve reproducibility of microarray measurements,
	they appear less effective in improving accuracy.},

	method for 2-color microarray data. This article develops the normexp
	method further by improving the estimation of the parameters. A complete

	saddle-point approximation. Some subtle numerical programming issues
	are solved which caused the original normexp method to fail occasionally

	is developed for exact maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) using
	high-quality optimization software and using the saddle-point estimates
	as starting values. "MLE" is shown to outperform heuristic estimators
	proposed by other authors, both in terms of estimation accuracy and

	signal to target concentration. Several theoretical models have been
	put forward to explain these data. It was shown that the Langmuir
	adsorption isotherm recapitulates a general trend of signal response
	to concentration. However, this model fails to explain some key properties
	of the observed signal. In particular, according to the simple Langmuir
	isotherm, all probes should saturate at the same intensity level.
	However, this effect was not observed in the publicly available Affymetrix
	spike-in data sets. On the contrary, it was found that the saturation
	intensities vary greatly and can be predicted based on the probe
	sequence composition. In our experimental study, we attempt to account
	for the unexplained variation in the observed probe intensities using
	customized fluidics scripts. We explore experimentally the effect
	of the stringent wash, target concentration and hybridization time
	on the final microarray signal. The washing effect is assessed by
	scanning chips both prior to and after the stringent wash. Selective
	labeling of both specific and non-specific targets allows the visualization
	and investigation of the washing effect for both specific and non-specific
	signal components. We propose a new qualitative model of the probe-target
	hybridization mechanism that is in agreement with observed hybridization

  abstract = {Mutation of the human genome ranges from single base-pair changes
	to whole-chromosome aneuploidy. Karyotyping, fluorescence in situ
	hybridization, and comparative genome hybridization are currently
	used to detect chromosome abnormalities of clinical significance.
	These methods, although powerful, suffer from limitations in speed,
	ease of use, and resolution, and they do not detect copy-neutral
	chromosomal aberrations--for example, uniparental disomy (UPD). We
	have developed a high-throughput approach for assessment of DNA copy-number
	changes, through use of high-density synthetic oligonucleotide arrays
	containing 116,204 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, spaced at an
	average distance of 23.6 kb across the genome. Using this approach,
	we analyzed samples that failed conventional karyotypic analysis,
	and we detected amplifications and deletions across a wide range
	of sizes (1.3-145.9 Mb), identified chromosomes containing anonymous
	chromatin, and used genotype data to determine the molecular origin
	of two cases of UPD. Furthermore, our data provided independent confirmation
	for a case that had been misinterpreted by karyotype analysis. The
	high resolution of our approach provides more-precise breakpoint
	mapping, which allows subtle phenotypic heterogeneity to be distinguished
	at a molecular level. The accurate genotype information provided
	on these arrays enables the identification of copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity
	events, and the minimal requirement of DNA (250 ng per array) allows
	rapid analysis of samples without the need for cell culture. This
	technology overcomes many limitations currently encountered in routine
	clinical diagnostic laboratories tasked with accurate and rapid diagnosis
	of chromosomal abnormalities.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To describe gene expression differences between healthy,
	young human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells from the macular
	area and RPE cells from two locations in the retinal periphery. METHODS:
	RPE cells from six human donor eyes, ages 17-36, without histopathological
	abnormalities, were dissected by laser and isolated from cryosections.
	Total RNA was isolated, amplified, and hybridized to a custom made
	oligonucleotide array containing 22,000 genes. Bioinformatic analysis
	was carried out using the computer programs Rosetta Resolver and
	the webtools EASE/David and GoStat. Confirmatory real time PCR (RT-PCR)
	and immunohistochemistry were performed according to standard protocols.
	RESULTS: Microarray and statistical analysis yielded 438 genes that
	were differentially expressed between macular RPE, and at least one
	out of two peripheral RPE locations. Out of these genes, 33 that
	showed fold changes of four, or higher, were selected for RT-PCR
	confirmation. For 17 genes (51\%), a significant differential expression
	was found, while 11 additional genes (33\%) showed a similar trend.
	Immuno-staining of one target (WFDC1) confirmed its differential
	expression on the protein level. Functional annotation and overrepresentation
	analysis independently defined extracellular matrix (ECM) genes as
	a statistically overrepresented class of genes in our RPE dataset.
	In total, 33 ECM genes were differentially expressed between macular
	and peripheral RPE regions. A subset of proteins corresponding to
	these genes is known to be present in Bruch's membrane. CONCLUSIONS:
	Our data showed that consistent topographical gene expression differences
	in the human RPE constitute around 1-5\% of the RPE transcriptome.
	These changes may underlie topographical differences in RPE physiology,
	and pathology and may reflect local differences in the molecular
	composition and turnover of Bruch's membrane.},

	replaced aspartate 516 with a valine, and one (1.7\%) replaced glutamine
	513 with a leucine. Deletion of the asparagine residue at position
	519 was detected in one isolate susceptible to rifampicin, but yielding

	by TRAIL (tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing
	ligand) it is common for some cells in a clonal population to die

	timing and probability of death in human cell lines. Protein state
	is transmitted from mother to daughter, giving rise to transient

	so that sister cells soon become no more similar to each other than

  abstract = {We set out to define patterns of gene expression during kidney organogenesis
	by using high-density DNA array technology. Expression analysis of
	8,740 rat genes revealed five discrete patterns or groups of gene
	expression during nephrogenesis. Group 1 consisted of genes with
	very high expression in the early embryonic kidney, many with roles
	in protein translation and DNA replication. Group 2 consisted of
	genes that peaked in midembryogenesis and contained many transcripts
	specifying proteins of the extracellular matrix. Many additional
	transcripts allied with groups 1 and 2 had known or proposed roles
	in kidney development and included LIM1, POD1, GFRA1, WT1, BCL2,
	Homeobox protein A11, timeless, pleiotrophin, HGF, HNF3, BMP4, TGF-alpha,
	TGF-beta2, IGF-II, met, FGF7, BMP4, and ganglioside-GD3. Group 3
	consisted of transcripts that peaked in the neonatal period and contained
	a number of retrotransposon RNAs. Group 4 contained genes that steadily
	increased in relative expression levels throughout development, including
	many genes involved in energy metabolism and transport. Group 5 consisted
	of genes with relatively low levels of expression throughout embryogenesis
	but with markedly higher levels in the adult kidney; this group included
	a heterogeneous mix of transporters, detoxification enzymes, and
	oxidative stress genes. The data suggest that the embryonic kidney
	is committed to cellular proliferation and morphogenesis early on,
	followed sequentially by extracellular matrix deposition and acquisition
	of markers of terminal differentiation. The neonatal burst of retrotransposon
	mRNA was unexpected and may play a role in a stress response associated
	with birth. Custom analytical tools were developed including "The
	Equalizer" and "eBlot," which contain improved methods for data normalization,
	significance testing, and data mining.},

	Later, a SARS resequencing GeneChip was developed by Affymetrix to
	characterize the complete genome of SARS-CoV on a single GeneChip.
	The present study was carried out to evaluate the performance of
	SARS resequencing GeneChips. Two human SARS-CoV strains (CDC#200301157
	and Urbani) were resequenced by the SARS GeneChips. Five overlapping
	PCR amplicons were generated for each strain and hybridized with
	these GeneChips. The successfully hybridized GeneChips generated
	nucleotide sequences of nearly complete genomes for the two SARS-CoV
	strains with an average call rate of 94.6\%. Multiple alignments
	of nucleotide sequences obtained from SARS GeneChips and conventional
	sequencing revealed full concordance. Furthermore, the GeneChip-based
	analysis revealed no additional polymorphic sites. The results of
	this study suggest that GeneChip-based genome characterization is
	fast and reproducible. Thus, SARS resequencing GeneChips may be employed
	as an alternate tool to obtain genome sequences of SARS-CoV strains
	pathogenic for humans in order to further understand the transmission

  abstract = {Numerical experiments on a personal computer are used to illustrate
	the degrees of freedom concept. Random errors from a known distribution
	are added to a known model, for example, $y(x) = \alpha + \beta x$,
	and the least squares fit to the model + error data is computed.
	The least squares fit produces a new model, $y(x) = a + bx$. By definition
	the sum of squared deviations between the least squares fit model
	and the data is always less than the sum of squared deviations between
	the original model and the data. When this process is repeated thousands
	of times on the computer, using different random errors each time,
	a pattern emerges. On average the difference between the two sums
	of squared deviations approaches an integer multiple of the error
	distribution variance. Furthermore, this integer equals the number
	of regression parameters in the model. For instance, this is the
	origin of the two degrees of freedom associated with a linear model.
	Using the computer it is easy to verify this property for regression
	models with more than two parameters and for different error distributions.
	The previous degree of freedom property depends only on the variance
	of the error distribution and use of the least squares method; it
	does not depend on the detailed shape of the distribution. However,
	when the normal error distribution with mean = 0 and variance = 1
	is used, a connection to another use of the degrees of freedom terminology
	is found. For a model with M parameters, the normalized frequency
	distribution of the difference between the two sets of squared deviations
	is calculated, using 2,000 computer trials, and shown to match the
	chi-square distribution with M degrees of freedom.},

  journal = BMCBioinfo,

  number = {1},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microscopists are familiar with many blemishes that fluorescence
	images can have due to dust and debris, glass flaws, uneven distribution
	of fluids or surface coatings, etc. Microarray scans show similar
	artefacts, which affect the analysis, particularly when one tries
	to detect subtle changes. However, most blemishes are hard to find
	by the unaided eye, particularly in high-density oligonucleotide
	arrays (HDONAs). RESULTS: We present a method that harnesses the
	statistical power provided by having several HDONAs available, which
	are obtained under similar conditions except for the experimental
	factor. This method "harshlights" blemishes and renders them evident.
	We find empirically that about 25\% of our chips are blemished, and
	we analyze the impact of masking them on screening for differentially
	expressed genes. CONCLUSION: Experiments attempting to assess subtle
	expression changes should be carefully screened for blemishes on
	the chips. The proposed method provides investigators with a novel
	robust approach to improve the sensitivity of microarray analyses.
	By utilizing topological information to identify and mask blemishes
	prior to model based analyses, the method prevents artefacts from
	confounding the process of background correction, normalization,
	and summarization.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: A variety of diseases are caused by chromosomal
	abnormalities such as aneuploidies (having an abnormal number of
	chromosomes), microdeletions, microduplications, and uniparental
	disomy. High density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays
	provide information on chromosomal copy number changes, as well as
	genotype (heterozygosity and homozygosity). SNP array studies generate
	multiple types of data for each SNP site, some with more than 100,000
	SNPs represented on each array. The identification of different classes
	of anomalies within SNP data has been challenging. RESULTS: We have
	developed SNPscan, a web-accessible tool to analyze and visualize
	high density SNP data. It enables researchers (1) to visually and
	quantitatively assess the quality of user-generated SNP data relative
	to a benchmark data set derived from a control population, (2) to
	display SNP intensity and allelic call data in order to detect chromosomal
	copy number anomalies (duplications and deletions), (3) to display
	uniparental isodisomy based on loss of heterozygosity (LOH) across
	genomic regions, (4) to compare paired samples (e.g. tumor and normal),
	and (5) to generate a file type for viewing SNP data in the University
	of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) Human Genome Browser. SNPscan accepts
	data exported from Affymetrix Copy Number Analysis Tool as its input.
	We validated SNPscan using data generated from patients with known
	deletions, duplications, and uniparental disomy. We also inspected
	previously generated SNP data from 90 apparently normal individuals
	from the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) collection,
	and identified three cases of uniparental isodisomy, four females
	having an apparently mosaic X chromosome, two mislabelled SNP data
	sets, and one microdeletion on chromosome 2 with mosaicism from an
	apparently normal female. These previously unrecognized abnormalities
	were all detected using SNPscan. The microdeletion was independently
	confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and a region of
	homozygosity in a UPD case was confirmed by sequencing of genomic
	DNA. CONCLUSIONS: SNPscan is useful to identify chromosomal abnormalities
	based on SNP intensity (such as chromosomal copy number changes)
	and heterozygosity data (including regions of LOH and some cases
	of UPD). The program and source code are available at the SNPscan
	website (http://pevsnerlab.kennedykrieger.org/snpscan.htm).},

	TopHat is an efficient read-mapping algorithm designed to align reads
	from an RNA-Seq experiment to a reference genome without relying

	a recent mammalian RNA-Seq experiment and recovered more than 72\%
	of the splice junctions reported by the annotation-based software
	from that study, along with nearly 20,000 previously unreported junctions.
	The TopHat pipeline is much faster than previous systems, mapping
	nearly 2.2 million reads per CPU hour, which is sufficient to process
	an entire RNA-Seq experiment in less than a day on a standard desktop
	computer. We describe several challenges unique to ab initio splice

	We have tested this expectation by examining the correlations between

	have identified probes that are not well-correlated with the other
	probes in their probeset but nevertheless are highly correlated with
	probes in other probesets. The common element of these highly correlated
	probes is that they contain a G-spot (a sequence of four or more

	little correlation with the other members of their probesets they
	are not fit for purpose and their values should be excluded when
	calculating gene expression values. This has serious implications,

	the circular binary segmentation (CBS) algorithm to divide the genome
	into regions of equal copy number. The algorithm tests for change-points
	using a maximal t-statistic with a permutation reference distribution
	to obtain the corresponding P-value. The number of computations required
	for the maximal test statistic is O(N2), where N is the number of
	markers. This makes the full permutation approach computationally
	prohibitive for the newer arrays that contain tens of thousands markers
	and highlights the need for a faster algorithm. RESULTS: We present
	a hybrid approach to obtain the P-value of the test statistic in
	linear time. We also introduce a rule for stopping early when there
	is strong evidence for the presence of a change. We show through
	simulations that the hybrid approach provides a substantial gain
	in speed with only a negligible loss in accuracy and that the stopping
	rule further increases speed. We also present the analyses of array
	CGH data from breast cancer cell lines to show the impact of the
	new approaches on the analysis of real data. AVAILABILITY: An R version

	with different clinical outcomes and different molecular features.
	The present study attempted to correlate genomic alterations (loss
	of heterozygosity; LOH) with subclasses of breast cancers having
	distinct gene expression signatures. Hierarchical clustering of expression
	array data from 89 invasive breast cancers identified four major
	expression subclasses. Thirty-four of these cases representative
	of the four subclasses were microdissected and allelotyped using
	genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism detection arrays (Affymetrix,
	Inc.). LOH was determined by comparing tumor and normal single nucleotide
	polymorphism allelotypes. A newly developed statistical tool was
	used to determine the chromosomal regions of frequent LOH. We found
	that breast cancers were highly heterogeneous, with the proportion
	of LOH ranging widely from 0.3\% to >60\% of heterozygous markers.
	The most common sites of LOH were on 17p, 17q, 16q, 11q, and 14q,
	sites reported in previous LOH studies. Signature LOH events were
	discovered in certain expression subclasses. Unique regions of LOH
	on 5q and 4p marked a subclass of breast cancers with "basal-like"
	expression profiles, distinct from other subclasses. LOH on 1p and
	16q occurred preferentially in a subclass of estrogen receptor-positive
	breast cancers. Finding unique LOH patterns in different groups of
	breast cancer, in part defined by expression signatures, adds confidence
	to newer schemes of molecular classification. Furthermore, exclusive
	association between biological subclasses and restricted LOH events
	provides rationale to search for targeted genes.},

  abstract = {Somatic alterations in cellular DNA underlie almost all human cancers.
	The prospect of targeted therapies and the development of high-resolution,
	genome-wide approaches are now spurring systematic efforts to characterize
	cancer genomes. Here we report a large-scale project to characterize
	copy-number alterations in primary lung adenocarcinomas. By analysis
	of a large collection of tumours (n = 371) using dense single nucleotide
	polymorphism arrays, we identify a total of 57 significantly recurrent
	events. We find that 26 of 39 autosomal chromosome arms show consistent
	large-scale copy-number gain or loss, of which only a handful have
	been linked to a specific gene. We also identify 31 recurrent focal
	events, including 24 amplifications and 7 homozygous deletions. Only
	six of these focal events are currently associated with known mutations
	in lung carcinomas. The most common event, amplification of chromosome
	14q13.3, is found in approximately 12\% of samples. On the basis
	of genomic and functional analyses, we identify NKX2-1 (NK2 homeobox
	1, also called TITF1), which lies in the minimal 14q13.3 amplification
	interval and encodes a lineage-specific transcription factor, as
	a novel candidate proto-oncogene involved in a significant fraction
	of lung adenocarcinomas. More generally, our results indicate that
	many of the genes that are involved in lung adenocarcinoma remain
	to be discovered.},

	RESULTS: We describe a comparison of three popular and publicly available

	segmentation results may be utilized in the downstream analyses such
	as testing and classification, yielding higher power and prediction
	accuracy. Since the methods operate on individual chromosomes, we

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microarray data are subject to multiple sources of variation,
	of which biological sources are of interest whereas most others are
	only confounding. Recent work has identified systematic sources of
	variation that are intensity-dependent and non-linear in nature.
	Systematic sources of variation are not limited to the differing
	properties of the cyanine dyes Cy(5) and Cy(3) as observed in cDNA
	arrays, but are the general case for both oligonucleotide microarray
	(Affymetrix GeneChips) and cDNA microarray data. Current normalization
	techniques are most often linear and therefore not capable of fully
	correcting for these effects. RESULTS: We present here a simple and
	robust non-linear method for normalization using array signal distribution
	analysis and cubic splines. These methods compared favorably to normalization
	using robust local-linear regression (lowess). The application of
	these methods to oligonucleotide arrays reduced the relative error
	between replicates by 5-10\% compared with a standard global normalization
	method. Application to cDNA arrays showed improvements over the standard
	method and over Cy(3)-Cy(5) normalization based on dye-swap replication.
	In addition, a set of known differentially regulated genes was ranked
	higher by the t-test. In either cDNA or Affymetrix technology, signal-dependent
	bias was more than ten times greater than the observed print-tip
	or spatial effects. CONCLUSIONS: Intensity-dependent normalization
	is important for both high-density oligonucleotide array and cDNA
	array data. Both the regression and spline-based methods described
	here performed better than existing linear methods when assessed
	on the variability of replicate arrays. Dye-swap normalization was
	less effective at Cy(3)-Cy(5) normalization than either regression
	or spline-based methods alone.},

	based on first principles. However, due to lack of tools, the observed
	microarray data have not been used to assess the performance of individual
	probes to provide feedback to improve future designs. RESULT: In
	this study, we describe a probe performance assessment method based
	on the concordance of the observed signals from probes that share
	common targets. Using this method, we found that probes containing
	multiple guanines in a row (G-stacks) have abnormal binding behavior
	compared with other probes, both in gene expression assays and genotyping
	assays using Affymetrix microarrays. These probes are less likely
	to covary with other probes that interrogate the same genes. Moreover,
	we found that these probes are much more likely to produce outliers
	when fitting the observed signals according to the positional dependent
	nearest neighbor model, which gives reasonable estimates of binding
	affinity for most other probes. These results suggest that probes
	containing G-stacks tend to have increased cross hybridization signals
	and reduced target-specific hybridization signals, presumably due
	to multiplex binding forming G-quartet structures. Our findings are
	expected to be useful in microarray design and data analysis.},

	for the measurement of gene expression on a large scale. Affymetrix
	GeneChip arrays appear to dominate this market. These arrays use
	short oligonucleotides to probe for genes in an RNA sample. Due to
	optical noise, non-specific hybridization, probe-specific effects,
	and measurement error, ad-hoc measures of expression, that summarize
	probe intensities, can lead to imprecise and inaccurate results.
	Various researchers have demonstrated that expression measures based

	the ad-hoc procedure offered by Affymetrix. Recently, physical models
	based on molecular hybridization theory, have been proposed as useful
	tools for prediction of, for example, non-specific hybridization.
	These physical models show great potential in terms of improving
	existing expression measures. In this paper we suggest that the system
	producing the measured intensities is too complex to be fully described
	with these relatively simple physical models and we propose empirically
	motivated stochastic models that compliment the above mentioned molecular
	hybridization theory to provide a comprehensive description of the

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Modern strategies for mapping disease loci require efficient
	genotyping of a large number of known polymorphic sites in the genome.
	The sensitive and high-throughput nature of hybridization-based DNA
	microarray technology provides an ideal platform for such an application
	by interrogating up to hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide
	polymorphisms (SNPs) in a single assay. Similar to the development
	of expression arrays, these genotyping arrays pose many data analytic
	challenges that are often platform specific. Affymetrix SNP arrays,
	e.g. use multiple sets of short oligonucleotide probes for each known
	SNP, and require effective statistical methods to combine these probe
	intensities in order to generate reliable and accurate genotype calls.
	RESULTS: We developed an integrated multi-SNP, multi-array genotype
	calling algorithm for Affymetrix SNP arrays, MAMS, that combines
	single-array multi-SNP (SAMS) and multi-array, single-SNP (MASS)
	calls to improve the accuracy of genotype calls, without the need
	for training data or computation-intensive normalization procedures
	as in other multi-array methods. The algorithm uses resampling techniques
	and model-based clustering to derive single array based genotype
	calls, which are subsequently refined by competitive genotype calls
	based on (MASS) clustering. The resampling scheme caps computation
	for single-array analysis and hence is readily scalable, important
	in view of expanding numbers of SNPs per array. The MASS update is
	designed to improve calls for atypical SNPs, harboring allele-imbalanced
	binding affinities, that are difficult to genotype without information
	from other arrays. Using a publicly available data set of HapMap
	samples from Affymetrix, and independent calls by alternative genotyping
	methods from the HapMap project, we show that our approach performs
	competitively to existing methods. AVAILABILITY: R functions are

	sensitive detection of LOH is enabled with accurate determination

	called "AsCNAR" (allele-specific copy-number analysis using anonymous

	LOH, or uniparental disomy (UPD), in a large number of acute leukemia
	samples. We next applied this technique to detection of UPD involving
	the 9p arm in myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs), which is tightly
	associated with a homozygous JAK2 mutation. It revealed an unexpectedly
	high frequency of 9p UPD that otherwise would have been undetected
	and also disclosed the existence of multiple subpopulations having
	distinct 9p UPD within the same MPD specimen. In conclusion, AsCNAR
	should substantially improve our ability to dissect the complexity

	the monitoring of expression levels for thousands of genes simultaneously.
	Image analysis is an important aspect of microarray experiments,
	one that can have a potentially large impact on subsequent analyses

	genes. This article reviews a number of existing image analysis approaches
	for cDNA microarray experiments and proposes new addressing, segmentation,

	an image analysis technique known as morphological opening. These
	new image analysis procedures are implemented in a software package
	named Spot, built on the R environment for statistical computing.
	The statistical properties of the different segmentation and background
	adjustment methods are examined using microarray data from a study
	of lipid metabolism in mice. It is shown that in some cases background
	adjustment can substantially reduce the precision—that is, increase
	the variability—of low-intensity spot values. In contrast, the choice
	of segmentation procedure has a smaller impact. The comparison further
	suggests that seeded region growing segmentation with morphological

	evaluation encompassing different reporter systems (short oligonucleotides,
	long oligonucleotides and cDNAs), labelling techniques and hybridization
	protocols. We used four oligonucleotide and two cDNA platforms to
	compare gene expression between two sample types. We determined the
	overall consistency (reproducibility) within each platform, and correlation
	among replicates within and between technologies. We find that the
	top performing platforms show low levels of technical variability
	that result in an increased ability to detect differential expression.
	Most importantly, we show the top four platforms are highly correlated
	with biological, rather than technological, differences accounting

	tools that are revolutionizing the measurement of biological systems.
	In this and other technologies, a number of critical steps are required
	to convert the raw measures into the data relied upon by biologists
	and clinicians. These data manipulations, referred to as preprocessing,
	have enormous influence on the quality of the ultimate measurements
	and studies that rely upon them. Many researchers have previously
	demonstrated that the use of modern statistical methodology can substantially
	improve accuracy and precision of gene expression measurements, relative
	to ad-hoc procedures introduced by designers and manufacturers of
	the technology. However, further substantial improvements are possible.
	Microarrays are now being used to measure diverse high genomic endpoints
	including yeast mutant representations, the presence of SNPs, presence
	of deletions/insertions, and protein binding sites by chromatin immunoprecipitation
	(known as ChIP-chip). In each case, the genomic units of measurement
	are relatively short DNA molecules referred to as probes. Without
	appropriate understanding of the bias and variance of these measurements,
	biological inferences based upon probe analysis will be compromised.
	Standard operating procedure for microarray researchers is to use
	preprocessed data as the starting point for the statistical analyses
	that produce reported results. This has prevented many researchers
	from carefully considering their choice of preprocessing methodology.
	Furthermore, the fact that the preprocessing step greatly affects
	the stochastic properties of the final statistical summaries is ignored.
	In this paper we propose a statistical framework that permits the
	integration of preprocessing into the standard statistical analysis
	flow of microarray data. We demonstrate its usefulness by applying
