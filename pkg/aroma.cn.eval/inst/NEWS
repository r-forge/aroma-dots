Package: aroma.cn.eval
======================

Version: 0.3.1 [2012-03-01]
o PREPARING FOR FUTURE: Updated TCGA vignette to also work when
  RawGenericSignals extends a data.frame, i.e. no longer provides
  reference variables.
o CLEANUP: There were some unnecessarily large vignette files.


Version: 0.3.0 [2012-02-26]
o Added testSeparation() for SegmentedGenomicSignalsInterface.
  It used to be part of the TCGA vignette.
o CLEANUP: Now the TCGA vignette utilizes toPNG()/toPDF() of
  R.utils (>= 1.11.0) to generate figures.


Version: 0.2.0 [2011-11-29]
o Added a namespace.


Version: 0.1.4 [2011-11-29]
o DEPRECATED: blockAvg() has been replaced by colAvgsPerRowSet() in
  the matrixStats package.


Version: 0.1.3 [2011-08-01]
o WORKAROUND: In order for the package to work with the most recent
  version of R devel, which automatically add namespaces to packages
  who do not have one, we explicitly have specify that this package
  should get function such as cat() from R.utils (instead of 'base').


Version: 0.1.2 [2011-03-18]
o No code updates.
o VIGNETTES: Updated the TumorBoost vignettes with more help 
  comments and to do more sanity checks and give more
  informative error messages.


Version: 0.1.1 [2009-11-01]
o Updated the dependencies.  For the record, the ROC package is 
  only needed in auc() of the RocCurve class.

o Updated the dependencies.


Version: 0.0.5 [2009-06-10]

  SegmentedGenomicSignalsInterface.
o Removed ROC functions for SegmentedCopyNumbers.


Version: 0.0.4 [2009-06-04]
o Removed obsolete dependency on the R.basic package.


Version: 0.0.3 [2009-02-09]


Version: 0.0.2 [2009-02-03]

Version: 0.0.1 [2009-01-29]

  raw copy-number estimates, e.g. CNAG, CNAT4, CRMA, CRMAv2, dChip.
o Created.
