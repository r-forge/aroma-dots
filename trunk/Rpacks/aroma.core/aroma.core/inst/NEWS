Package: aroma.core
===================

Version: 0.9.4.1 [2008-08-04]
o BUG FIX: readSequences() for AromaCellSequenceFile translated
  raw values to incorrect nucleotides.
o Added redundancy tests to aroma.core.


Version: 0.9.4 [2008-08-02]
o Public release.  Package pass R CMD check on R v2.7.1
  and R v2.8.0 devel on WinXP.


Version: 0.9.3.4 [2008-07-24]
o SPEED UP: Added patch for base::serialize() on Windows, 
  which in turn will speed up digest::digest() and all
  methods that use the latter to generate hashcodes.
o SPEED UP: Now as.character() for GenericTabularFile:s
  and TabularTextFile:s reports the number of data rows
  and the number of text lines as NA if the files are too
  large and cached results are not already available.
o SPEED UP: Replaced all which() with faster whichVector().
o Added getCreatedOn(), getLastModifiedOn(), and
  getLastAccessedOn() to GenericDataFile.  These a just
  wrapper accessing file.info() fields.


Version: 0.9.3.3 [2008-07-21]
o Now countBases() of AromaCellSequenceFile returns "raw" 
  counts if argument 'mode="raw"'.
o Now updateDataColumn() coerce values to doubles before 
  censoring them for raw and integer columns.
o Now findByName() assert that the data set name is not empty.
o ALPHA: Added setFullName() and setName() to GenericDataFile
  and GenericDataFileSet. The plan is to have these replace
  what getAlias() and setAlias() do today.
o BETA: Added setFullNameTranslator() to GenericDataFileSet.


Version: 0.9.3.2 [2008-07-16]
o BETA: Added setFullNamesTranslator() (for the files) 
  to AromaGenericFileSet.
o ALPHA: Added protected update2() to GenericDataFileSet.
o ALPHA: Added private ProbePositionEffects et al.


Version: 0.9.3.1 [2008-07-12]
o SPEED UP: Now all AromaTabularBinaryFile:s, such as AromaUgpFile,
  read data much faster after two modifications to readDataFrame():
  (i) rownames are no longer generate, if not asked for explicitly,
  and (ii) garbage collection is no longer done after each column.
o Added a general importFrom() for AromaTabularBinaryFile, which
  calls matching importFrom<ClassName>(), if found.
o Added support for 'raw' data columns in AromaTabularBinaryFile.
o BETA: Added readTableHeader().
o BETA: Added AromaCellSequenceFile.
o BETA: Added classes AromaMicroarrayTabularBinaryFile and 
  AromaCellTabularBinaryFile.


Version: 0.9.3 [2008-06-08]
o Package passes R CMD check on R v2.7.0 patched.


Version: 0.9.2.6 [2008-06-07]
o Update filename pattern for getOutputFiles() of AromaTransform.


Version: 0.9.2.5 [2008-05-25]
o Added AromaTransform (extracted from aroma.affymetrix::Transform).
o Added nbrOfArrays() to AromaMicroarrayDataSet.
o Now private xmlToList() handles more complex XML strings.


Version: 0.9.2.4 [2008-05-22]
o Added member 'chromosome' to RawCopyNumbers.
o Added gaussianSmoothing() to RawCopyNumbers.
o Added argument 'xOut' to gaussianSmoothing() in order to specify
  at what loci the smoothed signals should be calculated.


Version: 0.9.2.3 [2008-05-21]
o Now findPngDevice() search for a working PNG device in the following
  order: png(..., type="cairo"), png(..., type="cairo1"), 
  Cairo::CairoPNG(), R.utils::png2(), and finally plain png().
o Added gzip()/gunzip() to GenericDataFile.
o Added static findByName() and byName() to GenericDataFileSet.
o Added static getFileClass() to GenericDataFileSet.  This makes it
  possible to remove most fromFiles() from subclasses but also
  the validation of argument 'files' of their constructors.
o Added validate() to GenericDataFileSet, which is called at the
  end of fromFiles(..., .validate=TRUE).
o Added extractMatrix to GenericTabular(File|Set) and 
  AromaTabularBinary(File|Set).
o Added equals() and hasFile() to GenericDataFileSet.
o Added classes GenericTabularFileSet and AromaTabularBinarySet.
o Added stextChipType() for strings.
o CLEAN UP: Moved more classes and methods from aroma.affymetrix to 
  aroma.core: RawCopyNumbers, CopyNumberRegions, CopyNumberOutliers.
  Moved attribute methods from AffymetrixCel{File|Set} to 
  AromaMicroarrayDataSet.  Moved stextNnn() methods from AffymetrixFile
  to AffymetrixMicroarrayDataSet.
  Created superclass AromaMicroarrayDataSetTuple of AffymetrixCelSetTuple.
o BUG FIX: readDataFrame() did not read the first data row if there 
  was no column header; it was eaten up by a preceeding readHeader().
o BUG FIX: findAnnotationDataByChipType(chipType="GenomeWideSNP_6", 
  pattern="^GenomeWideSNP_6.*[.]ugp$") would find file 
  'GenomeWideSNP_6,Full,na24.ugp' before 'GenomeWideSNP_6,na24.ugp'.
  Now we return the one with the shortest full name.
o ALPHA: Now equals() for GenericDataFile:s uses the class, 
  pathname, file size and file-contents checksum to do the 
  comparison.  Similarly, for GenericDataFileSet:s, the class, 
  path, number of files, pathnames, and finally equals() for 
  each file pair is used for the comparison.  
o ALPHA: Added full name translation for GenericDataFile:s.
o ALPHA: Added UnitNamesFile.
o Package passes R CMD check on R v2.7.0 patched.


Version: 0.9.2 [2008-05-10]
o Took all core classes and core methods in aroma.affymetrix that
  are independent of the Affymetrix platform and placed the here.
o The version is numbered starting from the current version of
  aroma.affymetrix.
o BUG FIX: interleave() for Image gave 'Error in z[idxOdd, ] : 
  incorrect number of dimensions'.  The internal image structure
  is a 3-dim array.
o BUG FIX: When searching with 'firstOnly=FALSE', findAnnotationData() 
  was identifying files that are in "private" directory.  This is how
  affxparser::findFiles() works.  Such files are now filtered out.
o Created.
