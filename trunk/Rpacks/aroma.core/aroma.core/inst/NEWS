Package: aroma.core
===================

Version: 0.9.2.4 [2008-05-22]
o Added member 'chromosome' to RawCopyNumbers.
o Added gaussianSmoothing() to RawCopyNumbers.
o Added argument 'xOut' to gaussianSmoothing() in order to specify
  at what loci the smoothed signals should be calculated.


Version: 0.9.2.3 [2008-05-21]
o Now findPngDevice() search for a working PNG device in the following
  order: png(..., type="cairo"), png(..., type="cairo1"), 
  Cairo::CairoPNG(), R.utils::png2(), and finally plain png().
o Added gzip()/gunzip() to GenericDataFile.
o Added static findByName() and byName() to GenericDataFileSet.
o Added static getFileClass() to GenericDataFileSet.  This makes it
  possible to remove most fromFiles() from subclasses but also
  the validation of argument 'files' of their constructors.
o Added validate() to GenericDataFileSet, which is called at the
  end of fromFiles(..., .validate=TRUE).
o Added extractMatrix to GenericTabular(File|Set) and 
  AromaTabularBinary(File|Set).
o Added equals() and hasFile() to GenericDataFileSet.
o Added classes GenericTabularFileSet and AromaTabularBinarySet.
o Added stextChipType() for strings.
o CLEAN UP: Moved more classes and methods from aroma.affymetrix to 
  aroma.core: RawCopyNumbers, CopyNumberRegions, CopyNumberOutliers.
  Moved attribute methods from AffymetrixCel{File|Set} to 
  AromaMicroarrayDataSet.  Moved stextNnn() methods from AffymetrixFile
  to AffymetrixMicroarrayDataSet.
  Created superclass AromaMicroarrayDataSetTuple of AffymetrixCelSetTuple.
o BUG FIX: readDataFrame() did not read the first data row if there 
  was no column header; it was eaten up by a preceeding readHeader().
o BUG FIX: findAnnotationDataByChipType(chipType="GenomeWideSNP_6", 
  pattern="^GenomeWideSNP_6.*[.]ugp$") would find file 
  'GenomeWideSNP_6,Full,na24.ugp' before 'GenomeWideSNP_6,na24.ugp'.
  Now we return the one with the shortest full name.
o ALPHA: Now equals() for GenericDataFile:s uses the class, 
  pathname, file size and file-contents checksum to do the 
  comparison.  Similarly, for GenericDataFileSet:s, the class, 
  path, number of files, pathnames, and finally equals() for 
  each file pair is used for the comparison.  
o ALPHA: Added full name translation for GenericDataFile:s.
o ALPHA: Added UnitNamesInterface.
o Package passes R CMD check on R v2.7.0 patched.


Version: 0.9.2 [2008-05-10]
o Took all core classes and core methods in aroma.affymetrix that
  are independent of the Affymetrix platform and placed the here.
o The version is numbered starting from the current version of
  aroma.affymetrix.
o BUG FIX: interleave() for Image gave 'Error in z[idxOdd, ] : 
  incorrect number of dimensions'.  The internal image structure
  is a 3-dim array.
o BUG FIX: When searching with 'firstOnly=FALSE', findAnnotationData() 
  was identifying files that are in "private" directory.  This is how
  affxparser::findFiles() works.  Such files are now filtered out.
o Created.
