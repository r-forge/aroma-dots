Package: aroma
==============

Version: 0.94 [2008-01-15]
o BUG FIX: The package would not load in R v2.6.1 with "Error in
  as.function.default(c(value, if (is.null(bd)) list(bd) else bd),
  : use of NULL environment is defunct" and "Error: unable to load
  R code in package 'aroma'".
o BUG FIX: addFlag and setFlag() of MicroarrayData called witch(), 
  not which() :).
o BUG FIX: getDiameter() of ScanAlyzeData used a non-existing variable.
o CLEAN UP: Removed as.DataFrame() of Matrix. It was broken anyway.
o Package passes R CMD check on R v2.6.1 with some warnings and
  some NOTEs, but no errors. I am aware of these, but leave them
  for now for maximum backward compatibility because it has been
  a while since the package was last updates.
  No tests and no promises are made for version before R v2.6.1. 


Version: 0.93 [2006-07-04]
o BUG FIX: read() of ImaGeneData could not handle '#' in the Gene ID.

Version: 0.92 [2006-06-13]
o BUG FIX: From R v2.3.1 graphics::image.default() does not accept 
  xlim=NULL nor ylim=NULL.  Had to update plot.MAData() accordingly.

Version: 0.91 [2006-05-04]
o BUG FIX: An error would be thrown in getChannelNames() if the GPR header
  contained two headers with names containing "Type".  Thanks Valtteri 
  Wirta, KTH for reporting this.

Version: 0.90 [2006-03-28]
o Updated broken Rd links.
o Updated the references to publications.

Version: 0.89 [2006-02-23]
o Some people have newlines in their GPR name and/or id columns, which
  read() of GenePixData could not deal with.  Now we try to read such
  data by assuming different types of quotation marks around the cells.
  The first one to read the result table correctly is used.
o BUG FIX: The heuristic methods for trying to identify column names
  in GPR files failed to identify channel 3 and 4 fields in some cases.
  This generated warnings about unknown fields when reading GPR files.

Version: 0.88 [2006-02-13]
o The help pages no longer claims that the package requires the
  R.classes bundle.  Install stand alone packages instead.
o Package now relies on aroma.light, which provide light-weight methods
  for normalizing and calibrating data in matrices.  Many of the methods
  in aroma.light have co-existed in aroma for a long time.  A few of
  the methods related to affine normalization differed slightly in the
  two packages, although they had the same names.  Here is a list of
  important differences/updates from using aroma.light instead:
  * backtransformAffine.matrix():
    - Now the method returns only a single column if project is TRUE.  
      This is because all columns would be identical.
    - The average of projected data is now on the same scale as the
      average on non-projected data. Before the data was max(b) times 
      too large.
  * calibrateMultiscan.matrix():
    - Since backtransformAffine.matrix() now returns a single column
      if project is TRUE, so do calibrateMultiscan.matrix().
  * fitIWPCA.matrix():
    - Input data (X) is no longer returned; saves memory.
  * plotMvsA().matrix(), plotMvsAPairs.matrix(), and plotMvsM.matrix():
    - are also moved to aroma.light.
  * Internal functions tr(), scalarProduct(), and projectUontoV():
    - are also moved to aroma.light.
  * The PMT-RGData.dat example data set is now in aroma.light only.
o BUG FIX: read() of QuantArrayData gave "Error in method(static, ...) : 
  5 arguments passed to 'readTableHead' which requires 6".  This bug 
  must have been around since (at least) R v2.1.1, when the number of
  arguments were changed, cf. the fix for GenePixData in v0.84 below.
  Thanks to Napawan Polmee and Sumalee Kamchonwongpaisan, National 
  Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Thailand, for 
  reporting this.

Version: 0.87 [2006-02-08]
o The code for normalizeWithinSlide() in MAData and RGData assumed 
  argument 'method' was a single value, but it may be a vector which 
  then generates a warning.
o Updated broken links in Rd files.
o Replaced the "about" help page with a "package" help page.

Version: 0.86 [2005-10-28]
o Removed doCall() since it is now in the R.utils package.
o Package requires R.utils v0.6.3 or newer. Trust me!
o Rebuild package to verify it conforms to the renaming of argument
  'overwrite' to 'mustNotExist' and 'mustExists' to 'mustExist' in
  the static methods of the Arguments class.
o Added 'Suggests: sma' to the DESCRIPTION file, because sma is
  needed for the examples to run.

Version: 0.85 [2005-07-21]
o All default 'path' arguments are now NULL; do not use path="".
o Package now requires R.classes v0.62 or later and especially the
  new R.utils package (part of R.classes).
o Package do no longer make use of the File class.
o doCall() has moved to R.utils.
o Made classes TMAData, BMAData, TFilter and BFilter and related methods
  deprecated, because they are very old. It is better to use the limma
  package for this.
o Made class Replicates deprecated.

Version: 0.84 [2005-07-01]
o Replaced all internal image.matrix() with image270(). Now more 
  warnings.
o BUG FIX: GenePixData$read() would give "Error in read.table.default(...
  ...): 5 arguments passed to 'readTableHead' which requires 6".

Version: 0.83 [2005-05-03]
o Deprectated setField() in class MicroarrayData made GenePixData
  and a few other classes abstract. This method is now removed.
o Stopped supporting aroma for R v1.9.1 and before. The rule of
  thumb is to support only R versions that are less than a year old.

Version: 0.82 [2005-04-07]
o More of the read methods of MicroarrayData and Layout objects do
  now support gzip'ed files.
o Added plotMvsAPairs() for the matrix class.

Version: 0.81 [2005-03-23]
o Updated all methods utilizing lowess() and approx(), for instance,
  normalizeCurveFit(), so that approx() does not give warnings about
  'Collapsing to unique x values' anymore.

Version: 0.80 [2005-02-28]
o Package now passes R CMD check with only one warning about 'log'.
o Added getArrayLeft() etc. to SpotData.
o For some standard methods such as plot(), summary(), str() etc.
  the first argument has been renamed from 'this' to, for example, 'x'
  in order for these methods to match the generics and to pass
  R CMD check with less warnings.
o There should be no missing links in the help pages.

Version: 0.79 [2005-02-22]
o Added missing alias for 'aroma'. Now ?aroma should work.

Version: 0.78 [2005-02-21]
o IMPORTANT: If using R.classes v0.58 or higher, aroma has to 
  be updated, otherwise multiscan calibration and affine normalization
  will not give the same results as in previous versions. This is
  because iwpca() in R.basic have different defaults now and is
  used by the above to methods.
o More help on multiscan calibration, affine normalization and
  curve-fit normalization. 
o Removed require() for R v2.0.x and above.

Version: 0.77 [2005-02-05]
o Added first initial support for a general weight model. First
  method added are get- and setProbeWeights() in the MicroarrayData
  class. Added also get- and setWeights().
o Added light-weight normalizeCurveFit() and normalizeAffine() for the 
  matrix class with support for weights.
o Documented all arguments etc in order to get rid of warnings 
  in R CMD CHECK.
o Renamed old-style normalizeAffine() for MAData to 
  normalizeAffineShift() to be consistent with normalizeAffine() 
  in RGData.
o Updated the loess parameters for normalizeCurveFit() according to 
  G. Smyth's suggestions by email on 2003-03-17. 
o Added normalizeCurveFit() to RGData, which now utilizing the method 
  with the same name, but for the matrix class.
o calibrateMultiscan() is now using the calibrateMultiscan.matrix()
  method. Similar for the normalizeAffine() method.
o BUG FIX: The background transform in calibrateMultiscan() did not
  transform the matrix before subtracting. This made no difference when
  using the default constraint=="diagonal", but would introduce strange
  biases in others would be used.
o Added getLogRatios() and getLogIntensities() and their Rdoc comments.
  getM() and getA() are aliases for these.
o Removed deprecated dyeSwap() from all classes.
o Zero-one weights are now round off by round(w). 
o For backtransformAffine(), missing values are now excluded before 
  projection. 
o Added arg. na.rm=FALSE to tr(), scalarProduct(), and projectUontoV().

Version: 0.76 [2004-12-27]
o Now argument 'weights' for normalizeWithinSlides() will only have an
  effect on the fitting of the normalization function. All data points
  are normalized. Before, zero weights would also prevent the 
  corresponding data points from being normalized at all.
  (Note, there is a plan to introduce a more general concept of weights,
   which can be set on each individual spot and channel. When this will
   be implemented is unknown.)
o Added internal validateArgumentWeights() to MicroarrayData.

Version: 0.75 [2004-10-22]
o Reconstructed so that package installs on both R v2.0.0 and Rv1.9.1.
  To install, write:
  install.packages("aroma", contriburl="http://www.maths.lth.se/help/R")
  To install on R v1.9.1 or earlier on Windows, write:
  install.packages("aroma", contriburl="http://www.maths.lth.se/help/R/R190")
o Names of help pages for S3 methods are now in the standard R 
  format, that is, in <method>.<class>, and not <class>.<method> anymore.

Version: 0.74 [2004-08-15]
o Rename as.RawData() to getRawData().

Version: 0.73 [2004-07-01]
o Added constraint "baseline" and argument 'baselineChannel' to
  fitIWPCA(), and hence to normalizeAffine() and calibrateMultiscan().
o Updated all affine normalization methods. Major internal restructuring;
  now there is an internal core working on matrices only not relying on
  any specific aroma objects.
o Updated the read() method for QuantArrayData; it was not compatible
  with R v1.9.0. Also added help for its file format.

Version: 0.72 [2004-05-06]
o BUG FIX: GenePixData$read() opened a file/connection without closing it
  eventually resulting in an error with too many opened connections. The
  was a single left over code of line that opened a file and should not
  be there. Thanks Lei Jiang at University of Washington for reporting 
  this. 

Version: 0.71 [2004-04-26]
o Verified to load correctly on R v1.9.0. However, there are most
  likely broken links in the help pages since many functions has
  been moved into new R v1.9.0 packages.
o Added a few get methods to SpotPosition to get aspect ratios etc.
o Added the ... argument to the normalization methods of RGData, which
  is passed down all the way to for instance iwpca() method. This allows
  a weight argument to normalizeAffine() and calibrateMultiscan().

Version: 0.70 [2004-03-17]
p BUG FIX: Reading unicoded QuantArrayData files generated several 
  warnings about conditional test was done on more than one element.
o BUG FIX: Corrected a bug in as.RawData() of QuantArrayData complaining
  about 'this', which was introduced in previous version.

Version: 0.69 [2004-03-09]
o BUG FIX: Argument 'slides' of write() in MicroarrayData had no effect;
  all slides were written anyway. Thanks Johan Lindberg at the Royal
  Institute of Technology, Stockholm for reporting this.
  Updated the Rdoc comments for write() too.
  I also found out that write() for ImaGeneData, QuantArray, 
  ScanAlyzeData, SpotData and SpotfinderData were mistakenly accepting
  more than once slide at the time. It was a cut'n'paste typo and now 
  an error is thrown if more than one slide is specified.
o The R.classes bundle has been updated and recompiled to work fully
  with R v1.8.1. It was basically only the new error handling mechanism
  that made trycatch() in R.oo to be confused. Also, strsplit() is
  now not doing as.character() for you, which means that NULL and 
  numerics etc won't work. Had to update R.classes accordingly.
  Same with some aroma code too. Recompiled aroma. No other updates
  has been made.

Version: 0.68 [2004-02-25]
o BUG FIX: The Unicode reading in QuantArrayData$read() was broken,
  most likely due to a change in R.
o Included normalizeAffine() and calibrateMultiscan().
o Now read() and write() of GenePixData is sensitive to the "Wavelengths"
  header field, if it exists. Its contents is parsed (basically string
  split around '\t' and removes all known non-digits) and used as 
  channel labels. This replaces the hard coded "635", "532", "3" and "4"
  as used before. Another step towards multi-color/channel analysis.
o Added the readHeader() to GenePixData to read just the header 
  information and not the data. This is now also used internally by
  the read() method.
o For plot() in MAData the ylim will now follow the xlim such that 
  R and G, which are rotate 45 degrees in the M vs A plot, are still
  ortogonal to each other. This is recommended because the logarithmic 
  scale fools you enough anyway.
o Added internal generic validateArgumentGroupBy() to validate all
  'groupBy' arguments. All to make the API more consistent.

Version: 0.67 [2003-12-31] [Package renamed to aroma]
o PACKAGE RENAMED TO aroma.

Version: 0.66 [2003-12-31]
o Added plotMvsM() to the MAData class.
o Now the 'slide' and 'slides' arguments to any method also accepts
  slide names as given by getSlideNames().
o Renamed get/setSlideName() to get/setSlideNames() for the 
  MicroarrayData class. The old methods are made deprecated.
o Added a read-multiple-slides example to the ImaGeneData help. This was
  done on request from Giovanni Martinelli, Italy.

Version: 0.65 [2003-12-02]
o BUG FIX: In append() of GenePixData, I did rep(NA, nrow=...) instead 
  of rep(NA, length=...) ib a section of code that was rarely called,
  but still very important. Thanks to Jarmo Schrader at Umea 
  University, Sweden, for the report.
o Updated some broken links in the help pages.

Version: 0.64 [2003-11-18]
o When reading GPR files the estimation/guessing of the number of grid 
  rows was improved. Before it happend that it failed because some spot
  positions (x,y) were NAs. If that occurs, it will try again with 
  another set of spots and so on.
o When reading GPR files with "missing" spots, i.e. when the printtip
  groups are not completly rectangular, "missing" spots are inserted at
  the missing (Block,Row,Column) with all other values set to NA. The
  speed for doing this has been improved dramatically.
o Improved consistency of how different method interpret the same
  argument. Now arguments 'filename', 'path', 'slide', 'slides' are
  interpreted and validated in the same way for all methods.

Version: 0.63 [2003-10-30]
o Added support to call highlight(), points() and text() after calling
  plotSpatial() on a GenePixData object. Other classes will be support
  this too later.

Version: 0.62 [2003-10-29]
o Added support to read ScanAlyze v2.0 data files. Since this format
  is quite different from ScanAlyze v1.0, for now we have decided to 
  have a ScanAlyze20Data class to represent this "new" format. A write
  function still has to be written. Toby Dylan Hocking at UC Berkeley
  provided most of the code for reading version 2.0 files. Thanks!
o Added support to read gzip'ed Spot, GenePix etc data files. 
  Internally, this is (currently) done by extracting the *.gz file to 
  a temporary file, which is then read.
o Updated all getForeground() and getBackground() to choose the median
  estimates before the mean. For SpotData, getBackground() by default
  returns the morphological close opening (instead of morph.erode). 
  The as.RawData() methods already had these "corrections", which means
  that if you have only used those you will see no difference.
o BUG FIX: A typo made as.RawData() for ImaGeneData to return the *mean*
  instead of the median.

Version: 0.61 [2003-10-13]
o The background extracted by as.RawData() of the SpotData class is now
  i) morph.close.open, ii) morph.open, or iii) morph.erode in order of
  existance.
o append() in GenePixData can now append GenePixData object of different
  GPR versions. This means that read() can also handle different versions
  of GPR files at the same time and put them in a common GenePixData 
  object. Thank you Marcus Gry Björklund at AlboNova, Stockholm for 
  reporting the problem with reading different GPR versions.
o read() in MicroarrayData now gives a correctly spelled(!) error message
  if it did not recognize any of the data files. Thanks again to Marcus.
o Layout class: Added getLayoutGroupsByName(). Very useful in all plot 
  and normalization methods etc that have a groupBy argument. Added
  getPrintorder() and setPrintorder(). getPrintorder() is to replace
  toPrintorderMatrix(). Removed obsolete '.return' argument from set().
  Made setByLayout() and setExplicit() deprecated. 
o MicroarrayData class: Added getCache(), setCache(), clearCache(). 
o Internal updates.

Version: 0.60 [2003-08-29]
o BUG FIX: When reading two or more GPR v3 created by GenePix 5.0.0.x
  an error "getPixelSize(this) : Object "this" not found" was given.
  This happend since the new version contained the column "Circularity"
  and was in conflict with getCircularity(), which is a virtual field.
  Thanks Valtteri Wirta, AlbaNova University Center, Sweden for
  reporting this bug.
o Added some help for plotSpatial3d() in the MicroarrayData class.

Version: 0.59 [2003-07-29]
o Added help for plotSpatial3d() for the MicroarrayData class.
o Updated as.RawData() of GenePixData to by default use the *median* 
  estimates instead of the *mean* estimates of the foreground and 
  background signals.
o Updated append() of the MicroarrayData class to set the Layout object
  if such an object does *not* already exist, but the appended 
  MicroarrayData object has one. 
o Added an example to append() of the MicroarrayData class showing how
  one easily can read multiple GPR files one by one and convert each 
  to MAData objects that are appended together. This makes it possible
  to read 10-20 times more data files.
o Added shift(M,A,R,G,...) to RawData(), RGData() and MAData().
o Added getDuplicates(), getTriplicates(), getQuadruplicates(), and the
  more general getReplicates() to the GeneGroups class.
o Added an example to getIndices() of the Layout class how to get the 
  "alley spots", i.e. those spots in each printtip groups that do not 
  have eight neighbors.

Version: 0.58 [2003-07-07]
o It is now recommended to use Gordon Smyth's limma package
  (http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/limma/), which is part of Bioconductor.org,
  instead of using the somewhat out-of-date BMAData class and as.BMAData()
  methods. Gordon has done quite a bit of work on the Empirical Bayes 
  methods since Lönnstedt and Speed's paper first came out. For more
  information and links see help on BMAData.
o Added getBackgroundArea(), getWavelengths(), getPMTGain(), getLaserPower(),
  getLaserOnTime(), getLinesAveraged(), getTemperature(), getFocusPosition(), 
  getPixelSize(), getForegroundSE(), getForegroundSD() and getBackgroundSD()
  to the GenePixData class. Moreover, made all GPR header fields into
  regular fields too. This means that now the header fields are stored for
  *all* slides if several slides are appended together. Moreover, if a 
  header field contains TABS ("\t") they are used to split the field into
  a vector of string value to make it easier for the user to retrieve for
  instance the wavelength for each channel etc. Old 'settings' field is 
  removed. append() was updated to support the new header fields.
o BUG FIX: plotSpatial() of RawData and RGData did only work for "known" 
  fields. User added fields did not plot. 
o TYPO FIX: Updated Rdoc about 'CH*KSD' and 'CH*KSP' for ScanAlyzeData.
o Added getForegroundSE() and getForegroundSD() to SpotData. Moreover, 
  updated the Rdoc about 'badspot' and added information about IQR for
  non-statisticians. 

Version: 0.57 [2003-05-14]
o BUG FIX: getForeground() and as.RawData() in SpotfinderData did by 
  mistake return fg-2*bg instead of fg as the foreground signal.
o Update the help about 'logratio' in the SpotData class; it is not
  calculated based on the 'Rmean' but the 'Rmedian'. It is still 
  redundant though.
o The AndFilter and the OrFilter was mistakenly set to be abstract.
o Added and update even more of the help pages.

Version: 0.56 [2003-05-04]
o Added and updated many of the help files. Is now making more and more 
  use of the new Rdoc compiler, which means that the help pages are
  (automatically) more consistent with the source code.
o Added getBackground() and getForeground() to SpotData and friends for
  convienience. Other classes will probably follow later.
o The SpotSlideArray objects returned by getM() and getA() in RGData and
  getR() and getG() in MAData do now include a reference to the
  Layout object.
o BUG FIX: getM() and getA() in RGData gave an error because 
  SpotSlideData() did not exist. Should be SpotSlideArray(). 
o BUG FIX: getM() and getA() in the RGData class gave an error because
  SpotSlideData() did not exist. Should have been SpotSlideArray().
o R CMD check passes with 4 warnings.

Version: 0.55 [2003-04-08]
o Replaced all internal getClass() with data.class() to prepare for
  getClass() to return objects of class Class.
o getColors() of TMAData is (once again) returning red-green colors if
  colors for (M,A) is requested.
o BUG FIX: as.TMAData() gave "Error in var.default(Mi) : `x' is empty" if
  the matrix M contains a row with all NA's. Thanks Valtteri Wirta at
  the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm for this bug report.
o Renamed lowessLine() to lowessCurve() in MicroarrayData and made
  lowessLine() deprecated.
o Made bg.subtract in getSignal() of class RawData deprecated and
  replaced it by bgSubtract.

Version: 0.54 [2003-02-25]
o Added trial version of SpotfinderData to read and write TAV files
  generated by the TIGR Spotfinder software.
o Updated the Rdoc comments for SpotData to explain the three different
  morphological background estimates much better.
o Added trial version of class ExperimentalSetup, which provides methods
  for searching for and reading setup files that describes the experimental
  setup of a set of hybridizations. The purpose of such setup files are
  to collect information about experiments in one place and to provide
  means to easily access any data part of the experiments.
o For convenience, the default values for arguments in plotXY() of class
  MicroarrayData, the method which creates scatter plots, has been changed
  to ylog=xlog. For RawData and RGData the change also included ylim=xlim.

Version: 0.53 [2002-12-24]
o BUG FIX: setSlideName() failed if there existed a virtual field with
  the same name.
o When reading GPR files with GenePixData$read() and the gene name field
  contains "#" as part of the gene name, the internal read.table() treats
  it as a comment character and skips the rest of the line. Added 
  comment.char="" to fix it and the example GPR data file now contains
  a line with a # to verify/show that its works. 
  Thanks Sangsoo, South Korea, for the report and the fix.
o BUG FIX: Plot annotation such as putting a timestamp or slide name was
  also performed when highlight(), text() etc was called. Now it is only
  done when the plot is created.
o When reading slides from microarray data files the slides are now named
  as the basename of the filenames.
o BUG FIX: Update the static read() method in GalLayout to read both
  comma AND tab delimited headers.
o BUG FIX: as.RawData() in MAData and RGData did not work for data 
  containing only one slide.
o BUG FIX: The get*() methods of SpotData, GenePixData etc did not return
  a matrix if there was only one slide.
o Added argument 'groupBy=c("slide", "printtip")' for boxplot() to specify
  how the "boxes" in the boxplot should represent. The boxes are now also
  colored automatically if 'what' is "M" or "A".
o Added summary() to the MicroarrayData class. By default it is
  doing the summary on as.data.frame().
o BUG FIX: In v0.52 the column and row names of the fields were not
  preserved in transformations to other classes, e.g. as.RGData(ma).
o BUG FIX: If both MicroarrayData objects did not have the Layout object
  set, append() would throw an Exception. Now it is possible to append
  to object with no Layout set.

Version: 0.52 [2002-11-24]
o BUG FIX: From R v1.6.0 the binary version of this package would not
¨ load on unix systems even if it contained pure R code.
o Now read() of the GenePixData class can read data files where some 
  spots are missing. This is done by reconstructing the missing rows
  and adding NA's. Oleg Paliy at UC Berkeley requested this.
o Updated normalizePlatewise() with the argument 'slides'.
o Added the GalLayout class, which currently only contains the static
  methods read() and write() for reading and writing GenePix Array List
  (GAL) files. Note that as for GenePix Results files, to be able to 
  write a GAL file, originally it has to have been read from a GAL file.
  This is because all the header information must be written too and 
  automatic generation of header information is currently not supported.
o Minor update to write() of the GenePixData class: Header rows, e.g.
  "type=value" are not prepended by a spaces anymore.
o Made the data fields of RawData, RGData and MAData to be of class
  SpotSlideData, which extends MicroarrayArray.
o Added trial versions of classes Array, MicroarrayArray, SpotSlideArray, 
  GeneSlideArray and GeneReplicateSlideArray. These classes relies on
  the trial version of BasicObject in R.oo, which is a root class whose
  objects can *not* be referenced.
o Added internal support for different view for different kind of
  plot methods. For now that is all, but there are internal differences.
o Made getField(), setField() and set() deprecated in all MicroarrayData
  classes. There are plenty of old methods hanging around that should be
  removed and this is the first step towards that.
o Package passes the R CMD check under R v1.6.1 with 5 warnings (no errors).

Version: 0.51 [2002-10-28]
o Now read() of class MicroarrayData will automatically call the read()
  methods of its subclasses and thereby try all known file formats meaning
  that the end user can now alway call the same method for reading the
  data, e.g. mobj <- MicroarrayData$read(...).
o Added the normalizeQuantile() method to MicroarrayData and the 
  subclasses MAData, RGData and RawData.
o All stop()'s are now throw()'s and their message are a more consistent
  with each other and a little bit more informative.
o Added the virtual fields R and G to the MAData class, which are
  calculated on the fly. Same for the virtual fields M and A of RGData.
o First version based on the new Rx.oo core classes. Rx.oo is even more
  light weight that R.oo was and is using much more standard code. It
  is basically plain S3/UseMethod, but with references using 
  internal environment variables.

Version: 0.50 [2002-10-14]
o Renamed dyeSwap() to swapDyes(). dyeSwap() is still working but 
  deprecated.
o The plot functions of TMAData will now by default plot heat colors for
  T values.
o If any of 'col', 'pch', 'cex' to plotPrintorder() are vector they will
  automatically be arranged into printorder, by assuming they are given
  in spot index order.
o BUG FIX: Updated the read() method in the GenePixData to to be more
  forgiving and also accept unknown headers by assuming colClass=NA and
  not expecting any specific order of the headers. Update initated by
  bug report from Sangsoo, South Korea.
o Made (all) MicroarrayData classes implement the interface Morphable, 
  which means that no warnings will be generated if a new field is added.
o Made normalizePlatewise() public.
o Added getGeneVariability() and getMOR(). Made former getGeneResiduals() 
  deprecated and private.
o The read() method in GenePixData, QuantArrayData(), ScanAlyzeData() and
  SpotData() can now all read one or several files specified by names or
  by a pattern. This is identical to how readAll(), which is kept only for 
  backward compatibility, used to be. readAll() is deprecated and read()
  should be used instead. One step towards an easier API :)
o BUG FIX: read(), which replaces former read() and readAll(), inherited
  a bug from readAll() where the path argument was by default ".". It
  should have been "".
o Do not open any other screen devices than "Device 2", because then the
  postscript document generated by R CMD check will miss several figures.
  Now it generates 34 pages of figures instead of 5 as before.
o Package passes the R CMD check with 5 warnings (no errors).

Version: 0.49 [2002-09-12]
o Thanks to an update in R.oo (get it by install R.classes v0.31) and
  and update of this package it is now possible to exit [R] and save
  an image of the ObjectSpace to be reloaded the next time [R] is 
  started. For this to work, you have to quit [R] by Q() or Quit(),
  *not* q() and quit().
o Added support for automatically detecting 'sep' and 'skip' in the
  read() method of SpotData.
o Now the read() method of SpotData is much more forgiving and accept new
  unknown fields by just reading them in anyway. Before the one normally
  got the error "Can not read data file. Do not recognize the headers.",
  which was unnecessary.
o Removed all usage of S4 methods, i.e. no more need for the 'methods'
  package, because it is buggy and I believe has only reaches an alpha
  version stage. Better to use R.oo all over ;)
o BUG FIX: Some Spot data files do include a first row numbering column
  and others do not. Since I before tried to use scan() to read the 
  data I had to make different tests for the above. However, read.table()
  deals with such situations automatically, which is now used internally.
  Thanks Simon Lin at Duke University for reporting the bug.
o BUG FIX: SMA$loadData(), which is used in several examples did only 
  work on Windows machine and on others it crashed.
o Package passes the R CMD check with 5 warnings (no errors).

Version: 0.48 [2002-08-23]
o Added support to read Unicoded QuantArray files (by first translating
  it into a temporary ASCII file).
o Added the methods plotSpatial(), getSpotPosition() and getArea() to
  the QuantArrayClass.
o BUG FIX: Doing append() on a GenePixData, ScanAlyzeData or a SpotData 
  object would result in an (incorrect) warning saying "Trying to append
  a MicroarrayData object of a different class.". Thanks Simon Lin at
  Duke University Medical Center for reporting this bug.
o BUG FIX: Method normalizeWithinSlide(..., method="p") (or method="s") 
  in class MAData would give an error ('x is empty') if there were some
  grids with only NA values. This could be the case if some grids were
  not spotted or just contain empty spots. The extreme case where all
  spots on one slide are NA's is also taken care of. 
  Thanks Yoshiyuki Ito at Mie University in Japan for report this bug.
o BUG FIX: For the same reasons as above was lowessLine() in 
  MicroarrayData updated.
o With R.classes v0.30 all spots with NA values will be plotted with
  color NA, i.e. with a transparent or the current background color 
  depending on plot function and device driver.
o Package passes the R CMD check with 5 warnings (no errors).

Version: 0.47 [2002-08-18]
o Updated QuantArrayData to be able to read QuantArray version 3 files 
  too. Thanks Anita Grigoriadis, University College London for sending 
  me some sample files.
o Added readAll() to QuantArrayData.

Version: 0.46 [2002-08-13]
o Added a trial version of QuantArrayData. I could not find one single
  document online describing the file format so I had to rely on sample
  files for implementing read() and write(). I could only find one
  single QuantArray file on the web and therefore the testing of read() 
  has been sparse and it might not work with other versions.
o Package (still) passes the R CMD check with 5 warnings (no errors).

Version: 0.45 [2002-08-09]
o BUG FIX: The ImaGeneData class was hard coded to assume the value "auto"
  in Begin Header -> Begin Measurement parameters -> Segmentation Method
  when reading ImaGene files. Changed the code to accept any value.
  Thanks Sangsoo, South Korea for reporting this problem.

Version: 0.44 [2002-08-06]
o BUG FIX: In previous versions of GenePixData I did not have access to
  a GenePix v4.0 GPR file and I just wrote up the read/write code from
  the specifications. Thanks Sangsoo Kim, Korea, for reporting the
  problem and sending me a test file. Both read() and write() has now
  been tested.
o write() in GenePixData is not anymore making use of write.table()
  because the latter is adding additional and unnecessary blanks for
  numeric columns (to right align the values), This makes the files
  written unnecessary large, e.g. 20% larger. Now the GPR files read
  and written are approximately the same size. I also updated write() 
  to be a much more memory efficient by retrieving and writing chunks of
  data instead of all data at once. If this idea turns out to be really
  great the Spot, ImaGene and ScanAlyze classes will also be updated.
o Updated read() in GenePixData to deal with data header rows that 
  contain trailing blanks. Currently I do not know how to deal with
  leading blanks; a bug in gsub("^[ ]*", "", text)?
o If equals() in MicroarrayData returns FALSE, FALSE got an attribute
  "firstUnequalField" showing which field that was unequal. Note that 
  more fields might differ.

Version: 0.43 [2002-07-14]
o BUG FIX: When updating plotSpatial() (in v0.42) the argument 'include'
  stopped working. Thanks Jon McAuliffe and Oleg Paliy at UC Berkeley for
  reporting this.
o Updated paint() when called after plotSpatial() to make use of image()
  too.
o Updated getInclude() to support 'include' and 'exclude' as matrices too.
  It also is guaranteed to return a matrix (even if has one column).
o Changed the default highlight() symbol for plotSpatial() to pch=20.

Version: 0.42 [2002-07-02]
o Added a trial version of the ImaGeneData class. It supports reading
  and writing of ImaGene results data files of version 4.1, 4.2 and 5.0.
  Added two ImaGene example data files to the data/ directory.
o plotSpatial() is now making use of image() and not as before plot(). 
  This means that one can safely resize the graphs without have to worry
  about "strange" spaces add between the spots. This is a great 
  improvement.
o BUG FIX in GenePixData class: The field 'Log Ratio' was incorrectly
  translated to levels instead of doubles. read() failed to read column
  names that contains non-ASCII 0-127 characters, e.g. "Rgn R^2" where
  '^2' is ASCII hex 0xB2, octal \262, or decimal 178. Added a 
  "getRgn R2"() wrapper for the "Rgn R^2" field, which allows the field
  to be access as gpr[["Rgn R2"]] :)
o Updated write() in GenePixData to work for more different kinds of
  versions. Also updated its read() so it is easier to update to recognize
  new GPR file header versions. Added code for GPR file version v3.0, but
  haven't been able to test it.
o Added argument 'force' to getMOR() and did a small bug fix to it also.
o BUG FIX: as.data.frame() (and extract()) now return a data frame with
  the same column names as the original field names. Before the column
  names were translated into 'safe' data frame names.
o Added argument 'weights' to normalizeWithinSlide() on request from 
  Jon McAuliffe. Currently only 0-1 weights or FALSE-TRUE weights are
  supported, since lowess() does not support weights. If loess() would
  be used internally weights could be [0,1].
o BUG FIX: The read()/write() fix of 2002-05-20 (see below) was not fully
  correct for write(), which remained broken. A small update did it!
o BUG FIX: getSpotPosition() in the ScanAlyzeData class was broken.
o Rd fixes: Corrected several mismatched curly brackets in the Rd pages.
o Examples fixes: Updated several non-working Rd example codes.
o SMA$loadData() now calls gco() if [R] is running low of memory. The
  rational for doing this here is that loadData() is mostly used in Rd
  examples and when doing R CMD check on the package the gco() is never
  called and R CMD check will quickly run into memory problems.
o Made class QualityData, WangetalData and WorkData deprecated. 
o Package now passes the R CMD check with 5 warnings (no errors).

Version: 0.41 [2002-05-30]
o RGData constructor now accept vectors for R and G by calling as.matrix(). 
o Now the package reports its name, version and date if it was succesfully
  loaded.
o as.MAData() now sets M and A to NA if either R < 0 or G < 0.
  Requested by Lei Jiang.
o Minimized the number of warnings when loading packages.

Version: 0.40 [2002-05-21]
o BUG FIX: From [R] v1.5.0 the setClass() methods must be called in the
  correct order, which they now are. The symptom for this bug was:
  'Error in getClass.default(x) : "MultiwayArray" is not a defined class.'
o BUG FIX: From [R] v1.5.0 read() and write() in GenePixData would give a
  cohersion error: No method or default for coercing "character" to "NA".
  This was due to use "NA"'s instead of NA's in colClasses specifications
  to read.table().
o The automatic color generation now creates a little bit more red and green
  colors. Before the colors were a little bit too brownish.
o Added SMA$loadData() and SMA$unloadData() to load and unload the data set
  MouseArray in the sma package. The data set is about 10Mb large so it
  is wise to unload it when done. It is possible to specify which objects
  to load/unload. E.g. in most Rd example only the 'mouse.data' object
  is used, which is about 1.2Mb compared to 10Mb!
o BUG FIX: new(MAData(M,A)) transformed M and A internally in way so they
  lost the colnames, which defines the slide names. Slide names are used
  in annotation of plots.
o BUG FIX: highlight() for RawData and RGData would not work since
  the argument 'what' was never set.
o Cleaner Rd examples; introduced com.braju.sma$data in all example 
  codes, which replaced the old
    datapath <- paste(.path.package("com.braju.sma"), "/data/", sep="")
  Details: The structure com.braju.sma is automatically set when the
  package is loaded.
o BUG FIX: GenePixData$read() could not read Demo.gpr from Axon. It was
  a too old version of file format, but now it works!
o Added anonymize() and getBlank() to Layout class.
o Added getBlank() to MicroarrayData class.
o Added getArea() and getCircularity() to GenePixData, ScanAlyzeData and
  SpotData. Also added getBgArea() to GenePixData and ScanAlyzeData; there
  is no way to retrieve this information from SpotData :(
o Added trial versions of LayoutGroups(), PrinttipGroups(), PlateGroups()
  and GeneGroups(). Added the corresponding get-() and set-() methods
  in class Layout.
o TYPO FIX: Type fix in string returned by as.character() in class Layout.
o Argument 'col' now sets the color of the lines in lowessLine() in class
  MicroarrayData.
o Now 'col' argument in plot() and plotSpatial() can be color numbers.
o Added points() to the MicroarrayData class.
o BUG FIX: Fixed the coloring of spots in plotPrintOrder() in 
  MicroarrayData when plotting with include=from:to where from > 1.
o Added support for querying 'plate' in indexOf() in class Layout.
o BUG FIX: indexOf() in class Layout did only work on unique matches. If
  there where duplicates matches in the query on the first unique match
  was returned. Used match(v1, v2) instead of match(v2, v1).
o Added field plate, and hasPlate(), getPlate(), setPlate() and
  getPlateNumber() to the Layout class.
o Added as.data.frame(), read() and write() to the Layout class. Now one 
  can save the microarray data with the layout as
    write(ma, "foo.MAData")
    write(getLayout(ma), "foo.Layout")
  and then read it back by 
    ma <- MAData$read("foo.MAData")
    setLayout(ma, Layout$read("foo.Layout"))

Version: 0.39 [2002-04-20]
o Added a trial version of static method read() to the classes MAData, 
  RGData and RawData.
o BUG FIX: hist() now also exclude Inf's (in addition to NA's) before
  trying to plot. Before pretty() gave an error if there where Inf values.
  Bug reported by Lei Jiang.
o Updated the Rdoc comments with some more references other functions.

Version: 0.38 [2002-04-13]
o Updated indexOf() in Layout with two new optional arguments;
  ignoreCase=TRUE and regexpr=FALSE. Note that now regular expressions
  are *not* used by default, but exact (case insensitive) string matching.
  These modifications was trigged by questions from Lei Jiang.
o Added getSpotPosition() to get the physical positions of some or all
  spots. If no information about the *physical* positions is available
  then NULL is returned.
o Added default value of 'index' to getLocation() and getPosition().

Version: 0.37 [2002-04-03]
o Added argument 'solve' to read() in GenePixData to be used when the
  file format is not fully correct but you still want to read the data.
o BUG FIX: write() in GenePixData now asserts that each columns is saved in 
  the correct format; integers, doubles and characters.
o read() and write() in all MicroarrayData classes now supports File objects
  as filenames.

Version: 0.36 [2002-04-03]
o Updated normalizeAcrossSlides() to also accept rescaling of one single
  slide. This is useful if the slides are in seperated MAData objects.
  
Version: 0.35 [2002-03-29]
o BUG FIX: getID() and getName() in class Layout returned factors and
  not character string (as they used to). Corrected.
o getSignal() in class RawData did produce "NAs produced by integer 
  overflow in: R * G" where log base two for R and G was approx. >= 15.5.
  Corrected. Thanks to Lei Jiang at the Department of Chemistry, University 
  of Washington for reporting these problems.

Version: 0.34 [2002-03-25]
o Added getSpotPositions() and plotSpatial() to GenePixData and 
  ScanAlyzeData. The Spot software does not return the coordinates
  of the spots and for this reason these two functions are not
  implemented by the SpotData class.
o Added the class SpotPositions.

Version: 0.33 [2002-03-24]
o BUG FIX: text() in the class MicroarrayData did not work correctly if
  argument 'labels' was not explicitly set.

Version: 0.32 [2002-03-10]
o write() in MicorarrayData will now by default save the object as the
  data frame returned by as.data.frame(), i.e. if write() is not
  overridden by a subclass e.g. GenePixData, which then saves in a
  different format.
o BUG FIX: Argument 'slides' in write() was mistakenly named 'slide'.
o BUG FIX: extract() in MicroarrayData would neglect the special fields
  "slide", "spot" and "gene". This automatically also fixed the fact that
  as.data.frame() would not create these fields.

Version: 0.31 [2002-02-27]
o Made GenePixData, ScanAlyzeData and SpotData implement the new interface
  Morphable, which makes R.oo not report warnings when new fields are added.
o Since Rdoc in package R.oo now provides automatic generations of table of
  methods, all the Methods sections in the help pages are now up to date.
o BUG FIX: When reading GPR files using the GenePixData class, GPR files
  with white space in the ATF header (such as those written by the write()
  function) would generate a warning.

Version: 0.30 [2002-02-26]
o BUG FIX: getIndex() in FieldFilter did not work with the new R v1.4.x due
  to abs() don't accept data frames anymore. Made a work around.
o BUG FIX: as.BMAData() does work again after having updated the code to work
  with the new stat.bayesian() in sma v0.5.7
o It is now possible to write GenePixData, ScanAlyzeData and SpotData objects
  to file in the corresponding data format. This is a step toward easier 
  integration with software like GenePix etc.
o The classes GenePixData, ScanAlyzeData and SpotData now inherits directly
  from MicroarrayData, which makes the ResultsData class obsolete. All data
  fields in these classes are now stored as matrices. Before each object
  could only contain one instance of a XXX data in form of a data frame. With
  the solution reading several files and extracting the raw signal is done
  in just two lines of code without any for-loops etc.
o TO DO: The "Method" section in each help page for classes are out of
  date and has to be updated. Will probably find a way of generating them
  automatically from the Rd files.

Version: 0.29 [2002-01-25]
o com.braju.sma now requires that R v1.4.0 and that R.oo v0.31 is installed.
o Made read.GenePixData() a little bit faster. Also, it does not complain
  about not recognizing the "Rgn R2" field anymore.
o Renamed all class methods named 'get' to 'extract'. It turned out that
  get is not a very safe name of a generic function.
o The plot functions in the MicroarrayData class now annotates the plots
  with a timestamp, the author if set by options("author") and the
  dataset if set by options("dataset"). Some plot functions also adds
  slide and gene information.

Version: 0.28 [2002-01-10]
o Updated (mostly in R.oo) the bundle so it is compatible with the 
  new [R] v1.4.0 and J. Chambers package "methods". All ResultsData 
  classes (GenePixData, ScanAlyzeData and SpotData) now supports reading
  several files at once and returning the ResultsData objects in a list.
  Filename patterns are also supported.

Version: 0.27 [2001-10-02]
o Added a beta version of the BMAData class, which still has to 
  be documented.

Version: 0.26 [2001-09-28]
o Bug fix in normalizeWithinSlide(). Removed obsolete topSpots() method.

Version: 0.25 [2001-08-08]
o Added the static class SMA to ease to use function of the sma package.
o Added support for dye swapping individual slides (RawData, RGData,
  MAData).
o Added support for specifying the lowess function in the global
  lowess within-slide normalization (MAData.normalizeWithinSlide.
o Added the option to explicitly specify the lowess function used in 
  global lowess normalization. This can be useful in cases where you 
  have time series and you can only estimate a lowess function on the
  first slide, because succeeding slides have too many genes 
  differentially expressed.
o Minor updates in the documents.

Version: 0.24 [2001-08-07]
o BUG FIX: Automatic coloring of spots did not work correctly for 
  slides other than the first slide (MAData.getColors).
o Updated to work better with the updated R.oo package.
o Updated some documentation and examples.
o Most classes should also be more memory efficient.

Version: 0.23 [2001-07-17]
o Minor updates, such as removing the need of the MicroarrayData object
  in the highlight.Filter method. Also updated some of the documentation.
o This version requires that R.classes version 0.9 or higher is installed.

Version: 0.22 [2001-07-16]
o Some bug fixes, updated documentation, minor modifications in the API
  like removing the default method of normalization in
  normalizeWithinSlide etc.

Version: 0.21 [2001-07-13]
o Important bug fixes, improved documentation and a first beta version
  of hopefully useful Filter classes.

Version: 0.20 [2001-07-12]
o A first half-public version. The package's API is getting stable and
  major effort has been put into updating the documentation and its 
  examples.
o In addition to GenePix and Spot data files, now ScanAlyze data files
  is also supported.
o Note that still things will change, but you could start using it now.

Version: 0.18 [2001-06-28]
o Version 0.18 and before have been unofficial with an API that has
  been changing several times.

Version: 0.17 [2001-06-08]
