  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We have developed genomic tools to allow the genus Populus
	(aspens and cottonwoods) to be exploited as a full-featured model
	for investigating fundamental aspects of tree biology. We have undertaken
	large-scale expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing programs and
	created Populus microarrays with significant gene coverage. One
	of the important aspects of plant biology that cannot be studied
	in annual plants is the gene activity involved in the induction
	of autumn leaf senescence. RESULTS: On the basis of 36,354 Populus
	ESTs, obtained from seven cDNA libraries, we have created a DNA
	microarray consisting of 13,490 clones, spotted in duplicate. Of
	these clones, 12,376 (92\%) were confirmed by resequencing and all
	sequences were annotated and functionally classified. Here we have
	used the microarray to study transcript abundance in leaves of a
	free-growing aspen tree (Populus tremula) in northern Sweden during
	natural autumn senescence. Of the 13,490 spotted clones, 3,792 represented
	genes with significant expression in all leaf samples from the seven
	studied dates. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a major shift in gene expression,
	coinciding with massive chlorophyll degradation, that reflected
	a shift from photosynthetic competence to energy generation by mitochondrial
	respiration, oxidation of fatty acids and nutrient mobilization.
	Autumn senescence had much in common with senescence in annual plants;
	for example many proteases were induced. We also found evidence
	for increased transcriptional activity before the appearance of
	visible signs of senescence, presumably preparing the leaf for degradation
	of its components.},

	The question of when the distribution formula is exact is considered,

	a bivariate generalization of the inverse Gaussian distribution,
	are adduced. The formula is shown also to be exact for arbitrary

	the basic theory of transformation models to cover the cases where

  journal = BMCBioinfo,
  year = {2006},
  month = {jan},
  note = {{in press}},
  abstract = {Background: In an microarray experiment the difference in expression
	between genes on the same slide are up to 103 folded or more. At
	low expression, even a small error in the estimate will have great
	in uence on the final test and reference ratio. In addition to the
	true spot intensity the scanned signal consist of different kinds
	of noise, referred to as background, and in order to asses the true
	spot intensity the background must be subtracted. The standard method
	of estimating the background intensity is to assume it equal to
	the intensity between spots. In the literature, morphological opening
	has been suggested as one of the best methods toestimate this between
	spot intensity.
	
	Results: This paper examines fundamental properties of rank filter
	estimates including morphological filterestimates. The bias and
	variance of these filters are determined by the number of background
	pixels used andthe pixel distribution.The rank filter algorithms
	are compared to methods available in the software Spot fromCSIRO
	and GenePix by Axon Instruments. Morphological opening, in Spot,
	has a mean bias between -50 and-250 compared to a bias between
	1 and -2 for the rank filter and the variability of the morphological
	openingestimate is 3 times higher than for the rank filter. The
	mean bias of the second method in Spot, morphological close-opening,
	is between -5 and -15 and the variability is approximately the same
	as for morphological opening. The variability of the region based
	estimate of GenePix is ten times higher than the variability of
	the rank filter estimate and with slightly more bias. In addition
	to the GenePix estimate, a non-adaptive region based method is implemented.
	The bias and variability of this method is almost comparable to
	the rank filter.
	
	Conclusions: The performance of more advanced rank filters are equal
	to the best region based methods. However, great care must be taken
	when implementing these filters in order to get unbiased estimates.
	The performance of the previously suggested morphological opening
	is in general very poor with substantial spatial dependent bias.},

	free web-based database system for microarray experiements.

	methods are available to do this in a generic manner.
	
	We have developed a plugin dispatcher that ease the

  abstract = {We have implemented a self-contained package for DNA microarray analysis
	in R. The package is named aroma and is formerly known as com.braju.sma.
	The purpose of the package is to provide end-users with easy access
	to the latest statistical tools and methods, to provide other statisticians
	with a structured platform to develop and test new analysis methods,
	and to make our methods available to an audience as broad as possible.
	In turn, this give us most valuable feedback for improving the package
	and its algorithms. The package provides methods for low-level analysis
	and pre-processing of spotted microarray data with two or more channels,
	although the recent methods are applicable to single-channel microarrays
	as well. Many of the commonly known and widely used normalization
	methods have been implemented as well as our own normalization and
	calibration methods in both early and mature versions. A few high-level
	analysis methods do exist. Import and export of microarray data
	is supported for most free and commercial file formats. Support
	for new ones can easily be added. Connectivity to other microarray
	analysis platforms based on relational databases is planned. For
	exploratory data analysis, the package provides a large set of methods
	for visualization of data with automatic graphical annotations.
	Textual and symbolic annotation of graphs is straightforward. Generated
	graphics can be exported for on-screen presentations and high-resolution
	printed publications. Report generators for simultaneously creating
	documents in plain text, HTML, and LaTeX are available, making it
	easy to create batch analysis scripts. Detailed documentation with
	code examples and references to the literature are included. In
	order to provide time and memory efficient algorithms, an object-oriented
	design and implementation utilizing reference variables has been
	used. In addition, to minimize the risk for programming mistakes,
	a consistent application protocol interface (API) was developed
	by enforcing an R coding convention. This will make it possible
	for a new user to quickly become familiar with the structure of
	classes and methods enhancing overall productivity. To further minimize
	the risk for programming errors, method arguments are validated
	as far as possible and explanatory error messages are used. Priority
	is also on backward compatibility with previous versions, compatibility
	with other packages, and potential future packages. The package
	does not provide a graphical user interface (GUI) per se, but the
	object-oriented API and the fact that reference variables are used
	make it easy for third-party developers to implement a GUI for,
	say, everyday high-throughput normalization. The package is available
	online as open source written in 100% R for maximum accessibility
	on all platforms. Installation is straightforward.},

	method},
  journal = BMCBioinfo,
  year = {2005},
  note = {tentatively accepted},
  abstract = {Background:
	
	Low-level processing and normalization of microarray data are most
	important steps in microarray analysis, which have profound impact
	on downstream analysis. Multiple methods have been suggested to
	date, but it is not clear which is the best. It is therefore important
	to further study the different normalization methods in detail and
	the nature of microarray data in general.
	
	
	Results:
	
	A methodological study of affine models for gene expression data is
	carried out. Focus is on two-channel comparative studies, but the
	findings generalize also to single- and multi-channel data. The
	discussion applies to spotted as well as in-situ synthesized microarray
	data. Existing normalization methods such as curve-fit (``lowess'')
	normalization, parallel and perpendicular translation normalization,
	and quantile normalization, but also dye-swap normalization are
	revisited in the light of the affine model and their strengths and
	weaknesses are investigated in this context. As a direct result
	from this study, we propose a robust non-parametric multi-dimensional
	affine normalization method, which can be applied to any number
	of microarrays with any number of channels either individually or
	all at once. A high-quality cDNA microarray data set with spike-in
	controls is used to demonstrate the power of the affine model and
	the proposed normalization method.
	
	
	Conclusions:
	
	We find that an affine model can explain non-linear intensity-dependent
	systematic effects in observed log-ratios. Affine normalization
	removes such artifacts for non-differentially expressed genes and
	assures that symmetry between negative and positive log-ratios is
	obtained, which is fundamental when identifying differentially expressed
	genes. In addition, affine normalization makes the empirical distributions
	in different channels more equal, which is the purpose of quantile
	normalization, and may also explain why dye-swap normalization works
	or fails. All methods are made available in the aroma package, which
	is a platform-independent package for R.},

	to identify the channel biases uniquely. For this to be true it
	is necessary that some genes are differentially expressed, but which
	they are or what their relative gene-expression levels are do not
	have to be known. The method presented may also be applied to so
	called spike-in data. From the maximum likelihood estimator, estimates
	of the relative gene-expression levels for all dilution series follow
	directly. Given the estimated channel biases and scale factors,
	back transformation gives calibrated probe signals that are proportional
	to the amount of fluorophore in each channel. With the assumption
	that most genes are non-differentially expressed, the proposed calibration
	method makes the signals in each channel proportional to the corresponding
	gene-expression levels. Results: The model suggested is a heteroscedastic
	affine model where the standard deviations of the error terms are
	equal for all replicates that belong to the same gene, but may vary
	freely between genes. For a specific probe, the standard deviation
	in one channel is assumed to be proportional to the other channels.
	These constraints were chosen as a compromise between model flexibility
	and feasible parameter estimates. We investigate the properties
	of the parameter estimates from simulated data by comparing bootstrap
	and asymptotic confidence intervals based on normal approximation
	for different setups of number of genes and replicates. We simulate
	two-channel gene-expression data with technical dilution series
	from the suggested model and, in order to investigate the robustness
	of the estimator against model misspecification, a more general
	model for which the standard deviations are not only proportional
	to the gene-expression levels, but also the probe concentrations.
	We find that the standard deviation of the bias-parameter estimates
	is inversely proportional to the square root of the product of the
	number genes and replicates, provided the latter is not too small.
	For modest number of replicates, the standard deviation based on
	the Fisher information is a good approximation to the bootstrap
	ditto. When too few replicates are available, normality can not
	be assumed and the standard errors are under-estimated. For similar
	reasons, for different setups of number of genes and replicates
	such that the total number of probes are the same, we found that
	it is better to use more replicates and fewer genes, if possible.
	Comparing dilution series with uniformly and logarithmic-uniformly
	distributed concentrations better results are obtained using the
	latter. Availability: All methods have been implemented in the cross-platform
	R package called aroma, which is available for free from http://www.braju.com/R/.},

  abstract = {Background: DNA microarrays are routinely used to monitor the transcript
	levels
	
	of thousands of genes simultaneously. However, the array design, hybridization
	
	conditions, and oligodeoxyribonucleotide probe sequence impact the
	
	performance of the DNA microarray platform and must be considered
	by data
	
	analysis.
	
	Results: We analyzed the signal intensities of GeneChip microarrays
	in terms of
	
	a microscopic binding model. It considers specific and non-specific
	transcripts,
	
	which both compete for duplex formation with perfect match (PM) and

	(MM) oligonucleotide probes. Intensity simulations enable us to judge
	the
	
	accuracy and precision of gene expression measures. The accuracy of
	the
	
	estimated fold changes ranks according to PM-MM>PM>MM whereas the
	
	precision decreases with PM?MM>PM-MM where PM-MM denotes the
	
	respective intensity difference.
	
	Conclusions: MM probes possess the potency to correct the intensity
	of the
	
	respective PM probe for the non-specific background. The middle base
	related
	
	bias of the MM intensity must however be considered by improved algorithms

	to
	
	substitute the complementary mismatches on GeneChips by alternative

	the contribution of matched Watson-Crick (WC) and mismatched self

	Single base related mean sensitivity values rank in ascending order

	GeneChip probe sensitivities divides the probe intensity into an averaged

	relative measure of the RNA target concentration and the sensitivity

	into additive terms because of specific and nonspecific hybridization,

	mainly caused by variations of the probe affinity for target binding

	consider the base composition and sequence of the probes. We found

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: When running experiments that involve multiple high density
	oligonucleotide arrays, it is important to remove sources of variation
	between arrays of non-biological origin. Normalization is a process
	for reducing this variation. It is common to see non-linear relations
	between arrays and the standard normalization provided by Affymetrix
	does not perform well in these situations. RESULTS: We present three
	methods of performing normalization at the probe intensity level.
	These methods are called complete data methods because they make
	use of data from all arrays in an experiment to form the normalizing
	relation. These algorithms are compared to two methods that make
	use of a baseline array: a one number scaling based algorithm and
	a method that uses a non-linear normalizing relation by comparing
	the variability and bias of an expression measure. Two publicly
	available datasets are used to carry out the comparisons. The simplest
	and quickest complete data method is found to perform favorably.
	AVAILABILITY: Software implementing all three of the complete data
	normalization methods is available as part of the R package Affy,

  abstract = {From microarray measurement, we seek differentiation of mRNA expressions
	among different biological samples. However, each array has a 'block
	effect' due to uncontrolled variation. The statistical treatment
	of reducing the block effect is usually referred to as normalization.
	Our perspective is to find a transformation that matches the distributions
	of hybridization levels of those probes corresponding to undifferentiated
	genes between arrays. We address two important issues. First, array-specific
	spatial patterns exist due to uneven hybridization and measurement
	process. Second, in some cases a substantially large portion of
	genes are differentially expressed between a target and a reference
	array. For the purpose of normalization we need to identify a subset
	that exclude those probes corresponding to differentially expressed
	genes and abnormal probes due to experimental variation. Least trimmed
	squares (LTS) is a natural choice to achieve this goal. Substantial
	differentiation is protected in LTS by setting an appropriate trimming
	fraction. To take into account any spatial pattern of hybridization,
	we divide each array into sub-arrays and normalize probe intensities
	within each sub-array. We illustrate the problem and solution through
	an Affymetrix spike-in dataset with defined perturbation and a dataset
	of primate brain expression.},

	Systems employs chemistry in microarrays, fluorescence reading,
	and bioinformatics to gain insight into the metabolic regulation
	of the glycolytic pathway. In this research program silicon-based
	labs-on-chips are being developed; each vial on the microarray will
	be equipped with various sensors and actuators. With this kind of
	microarray technology enormous amounts of data will be generated.
	Development of dedicated data analysis and data interpretation systems
	is necessary to extract useful information from the experimental
	data and to combine that with present data and knowledge. Currently,
	the enzyme-catalyzed reactions of this pathway can be monitored
	in microarrays via the production or consumption of NADH. The activity
	levels of the enzymes involved in the reactions can be derived from
	the production or consumption rates of this fluorescent molecule.
	The biochemical reactions are monitored with a modified conventional
	microscope system equipped with a scientific grade CCD camera. With
	low power optics fluorescent signals from an entire microarray can
	be acquired in a single image. This allows for a parallel readout
	of the microarray. Wide field-of-view imaging, however, is at the
	expense of absolute sensitivity. High power optics guarantees a
	high collection efficiency, but implies a sequential readout of
	the microarray. With this kind of microarray reading system, there
	are two possible limiting factors in the instrument that determine
	the lowest detectable concentration of fluorescent particles. These
	limiting factors are stray light and readout noise. If readout noise
	limits the detection, then the detection limit can be lowered by
	imaging the fluorescent signal onto as few pixels as possible. This
	can be accomplished by choosing a CCD camera with large pixels,
	where each pixel has a low readout noise level. A second modification
	is to demagnify the image by placing a second objective back-to-back
	to the primary objective lens in the emission path. If stray light
	limits the detection, then a better detector will not result in
	a lower detection limit, since it will not improve the signal-to-noise
	ratio of the measurements. Applying the same modifications to the
	microscope system will result in a faster scanning rate of the microarray.
	We have demonstrated the functionality of our conventional microscope-based
	microarray reader for this research program by monitoring an NADH
	producing and consuming reaction at different enzyme activity levels
	in the microarrays. Monitoring Dynamic Liquid Behavior in Micromachined
	Vials. Evaporation is a key problem in the development of micrarray
	technology, especially in the case of open reactors. Within the
	framework of this research program methods to avoid fast evaporation
	of solvents have been developed. Still, the process of evaporation
	at a nanoliter scale is an interesting phenomenon to study, and
	a requirement for calibration of a dedicated impedance based volume
	sensor. Quantitative measurements of the dynamic process of evaporation
	in the vials of our microarrays requires sufficient spatial (lateral
	and axial) as well as temporal sampling. Interference-contrast microscopy
	is a technique that satisfies both sampling requirements. With this
	technique an interference pattern is generated at the air-liquid
	interface of the evaporating liquid sample. This interference pattern
	shows fringes of equal height. With a temporal phase unwrapping
	algorithm these fringe patterns are analyzed in time point-by-point.
	With this algorithm the height profile of the air-liquid interface
	can be reconstructed without using any spatial correlating function.
	The instant that the air-liquid interface is perfectly flat is used
	to calibrate all one-dimensional height maps. Applying this technique
	to reconstruct the shape of the interface that generated this fringe
	pattern requires only spatial sampling at half the Nyquist frequency,
	whereas a spatial phase unwrapping technique requires spatial sampling
	at the Nyquist frequency. A straightforward measurement from these
	results is the remaining liquid volume as a function of time, and
	from that the evaporation rate. A counterintuitive result is that
	the evaporation rate is proportional to the perimeter of the vial,
	and not to the area of the air-liquid interface. This can be explained
	by the fact that the liquid is pinned to the edge of the vial and
	that diffusion is the rate limiting step of the evaporation process.
	Furthermore, when there are objects present on the bottom of the
	vials, these objects introduce phase differences in the interference
	pattern, which are observed as segmented fringes. Spatial phase
	unwrapping algorithms will fail analyzing patterns with segmented
	fringes. A temporal phase unwrapping algorithm, however, is insensitive
	for these kind of segmented fringes. With this technique it is possible
	to measure the height of objects on a nanometer scale. },

	This paper describes statistical methods for the identification
	of differentially expressed genes in replicated cDNA microarray
	experiments. Although it is not the main focus of the paper, we
	stress the importance of issues such as image processing and normalization.
	Image processing is required to extract measures of transcript abundance
	for each gene spotted on the array from the laser scan images. Normalization
	is needed to identify and remove systematic sources of variation,
	such as differing dye labeling efficiencies and scanning properties.
	There can be many systematic sources of variation and their effects
	can be large relative to the effects of interest. After a brief
	presentation of our image processing method, we describe a within-slide
	normalization approach which handles spatial and intensity dependent
	effects on the measured expression levels. Given suitably normalized
	data, our proposed method for the identification of single differentially
	expressed genes is to consider a univariate testing problem for
	each gene and then correct for multiple testing using adjusted p-values.
	No specific parametric form is assumed for the distribution of the
	expression levels and a permutation procedure is used to estimate
	the joint null distribution of the test statistics for each gene.
	Several data displays are suggested for the visual identification
	of genes with altered expression and of important features of these
	genes. The above methods are applied to microarray data from a study
	of gene expression in two mouse models with very low HDL cholesterol
	levels. The genes identified using data from replicated slides are
	compared to those obtained by applying recently published single-slide
	methods.},

	We consider the use of median filters to reduce noise levels in

	We also consider, as alternative estimators of spot intensity, discs
	of fixed radius, proportions of histograms and k-means clustering,
	either with or without a square-root intensity transformation and
	background subtraction. We identify, using combinatoric procedures,
	optimal filter and estimator parameters, in achieving consistency

	on a single array. The copy number algorithm jointly uses PM intensity
	and discrimination ratios between paired PM and MM intensity values
	to identify and estimate genetic copy number changes. Values from
	an experimental sample are compared with SNP-specific distributions
	derived from a reference set containing over 100 normal individuals
	to gain statistical power. Genomic regions with statistically significant
	copy number changes can be identified using both single point analysis
	and contiguous point analysis of SNP intensities. We identified
	multiple regions of amplification and deletion using a panel of
	human breast cancer cell lines. We verified these results using
	an independent method based on quantitative polymerase chain reaction
	and found that our approach is both sensitive and specific and can
	tolerate samples which contain a mixture of both tumour and normal
	DNA. In addition, by using known allele frequencies from the reference
	set, statistically significant genomic intervals can be identified
	containing contiguous stretches of homozygous markers, potentially
	allowing the detection of regions undergoing loss of heterozygosity
	(LOH) without the need for a matched normal control sample. The
	coupling of LOH analysis, via SNP genotyping, with copy number estimations
	using a single array provides additional insight into the structure
	of genomic alterations. With mean and median inter-SNP euchromatin
	distances of 244 kilobases (kb) and 119 kb, respectively, this method
	affords a resolution that is not easily achievable with non-oligonucleotide-based
	experimental approaches.},

  abstract = {In this paper we report exploratory analyses of high-density oligonucleotide
	array data from the Affymetrix GeneChip system with the objective
	of improving upon currently used measures of gene expression. Our
	analyses make use of three data sets: a small experimental study
	consisting of 5 MGU74A mouse GeneChip arrays, part of the data from
	an extensive spike-in study conducted by Gene Logic andWyeths Genetics
	Institute involving 95 HG-U95A human GeneChip arrays; and part of
	a dilution study conducted by Gene Logic involving 75 HG-U95A GeneChip
	arrays. We display some familiar features of the perfect match and
	mismatch probe (PM and MM) values of these data, and examine the
	variance-mean relationship with probe-level data from probes believed
	to be defective, and so delivering noise only. We explain why we
	need to normalize the arrays to one another using probe level intensities.
	We then examine the behavior of the PM and MM using spike-in data
	and assess three commonly used summary measures: Affymetrixs i)
	average difference (AvDiff) and ii) MAS 5.0 signal, and iii) the
	Li and Wong multiplicative model-based expression index (MBEI).
	The exploratory data analyses of the probe level data motivate a
	new summary measure that is a robust multi-array average (RMA) of
	background adjusted, normalized, and log transformed PM values.
	We evaluate the four expression summary measures using the dilution
	study data, assessing their behavior in terms of bias, variance
	and (for MBEI and RMA) model fit. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms
	in terms of their ability to detect known levels of differential
	expression using the spike-in data. We conclude that there is no
	obvious downside to using RMA and attaching a standard error (SE)
	to this quantity using a linear model which removes probe-specific
	affinities. An R package with the functions used for the analyses
	in this paper is part of the Bioconductor project and can be downloaded

	simultaneously. The analysis of such experiments is nontrivial because
	of large data size and many levels of variation introduced at different
	stages of the experiments. The analysis is further complicated by
	the large differences that may exist among different probes used
	to interrogate the same gene. However, an attractive feature of
	high-density oligonucleotide arrays such as those produced by photolithography
	and inkjet technology is the standardization of chip manufacturing
	and hybridization process. As a result, probe-specific biases, although
	significant, are highly reproducible and predictable, and their
	adverse effect can be reduced by proper modeling and analysis methods.
	Here, we propose a statistical model for the probe-level data, and
	develop model-based estimates for gene expression indexes. We also
	present model-based methods for identifying and handling cross-hybridizing
	probes and contaminating array regions. Applications of these results
	will be presented elsewhere.},

	microarrays are collected by scanning the signal intensities of
	the corresponding spots by dedicated fluorescence scanners. The
	major scanner settings for increasing the spot intensities are the
	laser power and the voltage of the photomultiplier tube (PMT). It
	is required that the expression ratios are independent of these
	settings. We have investigated the relationships between PMT voltage,
	spot intensities, and expression ratios for different scanners,
	in order to define an optimal scanning procedure. RESULTS: All scanners
	showed a limited intensity range from 200 to 50 000 (mean spot intensity),
	for which the expression ratios were independent of PMT voltage.
	This usable intensity range was considerably less than the maximum
	detection range of the PMTs. The use of spot and background intensities
	outside this range led to errors in the ratios. The errors at high
	intensities were caused by saturation of pixel intensities within
	the spots. An algorithm was developed to correct the intensities
	of these spots, and, hence, extend the upper limit of the usable
	intensity range. CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that the PMT voltage
	should be increased to avoid intensities of the weakest spots below
	the usable range, allowing the brightest spots to reach the level
	of saturation. Subsequently, a second set of images should be acquired
	with a lower PMT setting such that no pixels are in saturation.
	Reliable data for spots with saturation in the first set of images
	can easily be extracted from the second set of images by the use
	of our algorithm. This procedure would lead to an increase in the
	accuracy of the data and in the number of data points achieved in
	each experiment compared to traditional procedures.},

	the number of unknown parameters increases with the sample size.
	Neyman and Scott (1948) had demonstrated that maximum likelihood
	estimators (MLE) of structural parameters may be inconsistent in
	this case. Patefield (1977) further observed that the asymptotic
	covariance matrix of the MLE is not equal to the inverse of the
	information matrix. In this paper we establish asymptotic properties
	of estimators (which include in particular the MLE) obtained via
	the usual likelihood approach when the incidental parameters are
	first replaced by their estimates (which are allowed to depend on
	the structural parameters). Conditions for consistency and asymptotic
	normality together with a proper formula for the asymptotic covariance
	matrix are given. The results are illustrated and applied to the
	problem of estimating linear functional relationships, and mild
	conditions on the incidental parameters for the MLE (or an adjusted
	MLE) to be consistent and asymptotically normal are obtained. These
	conditions are weaker than those imposed by previous authors.},

	The dendrimer method requires the smallest quantity of sample, 2.5
	µg of total RNA compared with 20 µg with the direct or indirect
	methods. Therefore, we wanted to know whether the performance of
	the dendrimer method is comparable to the other methods, or whether
	significant information is lost. Performance can be considered in
	terms of sensitivity, dynamic range, and reproducibility of the
	quantitative signals for gene intensity. We compared the three labeling
	methods by generating three sets of eight self-to-self hybridizations
	using the same total RNA sample in all cases ("replicate study").
	In our analysis, we controlled for the effects of print-tip and
	background subtraction biases. We also performed a smaller study,
	namely, a dilution series study with five dilution points per labeling
	method, to evaluate one aspect of predictive ability. From the replicate
	study, the dendrimer method appeared to perform as well, and often
	better, with respect to reproducibility and ability to detect expression.
	However, in the dilution series study, this method was outperformed
	by the other two in terms of predictive ability and did not perform
	very well. These findings are helping to guide our decisions on
	what labeling method to use for subsequent studies, based on the

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The biomedical community is developing new methods of
	data analysis to more efficiently process the massive data sets
	produced by microarray experiments. Systematic and global mathematical
	approaches that can be readily applied to a large number of experimental
	designs become fundamental to correctly handle the otherwise overwhelming
	data sets. RESULTS: The gene selection model presented herein is
	based on the observation that: (1) variance of gene expression is
	a function of absolute expression; (2) one can model this relationship
	in order to set an appropriate lower fold change limit of significance;
	and (3) this relationship defines a function that can be used to
	select differentially expressed genes. The model first evaluates
	fold change (FC) across the entire range of absolute expression
	levels for any number of experimental conditions. Genes are systematically
	binned, and those genes within the top X\% of highest FCs for each
	bin are evaluated both with and without the use of replicates. A
	function is fitted through the top X\% of each bin, thereby defining
	a limit fold change. All genes selected by the 5\% FC model lie
	above measurement variability using a within standard deviation
	(SDwithin) confidence level of 99.9\%. Real time-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis
	demonstrated 85.7\% concordance with microarray data selected by
	the limit function. CONCLUSION: The FC model can confidently select
	differentially expressed genes as corroborated by variance data
	and RT-PCR. The simplicity of the overall process permits selecting
	model limits that best describe experimental data by extracting
	information on gene expression patterns across the range of expression
	levels. Genes selected by this process can be consistently compared
	between experiments and enables the user to globally extract information
	with a high degree of confidence.},

	allele-based copy number detection in cancer genomes, which can

	These improvements allow for highly reliable comparison of data

  abstract = {Gene dosage variations occur in many diseases. In cancer, deletions
	and copy number increases contribute to alterations in the expression
	of tumour-suppressor genes and oncogenes, respectively. Developmental
	abnormalities, such as Down, Prader Willi, Angelman and Cri du Chat
	syndromes, result from gain or loss of one copy of a chromosome
	or chromosomal region. Thus, detection and mapping of copy number
	abnormalities provide an approach for associating aberrations with
	disease phenotype and for localizing critical genes. Comparative
	genomic hybridization (CGH) was developed for genome-wide analysis
	of DNA sequence copy number in a single experiment. In CGH, differentially
	labelled total genomic DNA from a 'test' and a 'reference' cell
	population are cohybridized to normal metaphase chromosomes, using
	blocking DNA to suppress signals from repetitive sequences. The
	resulting ratio of the fluorescence intensities at a location on
	the 'cytogenetic map', provided by the chromosomes, is approximately
	proportional to the ratio of the copy numbers of the corresponding
	DNA sequences in the test and reference genomes. CGH has been broadly
	applied to human and mouse malignancies. The use of metaphase chromosomes,
	however, limits detection of events involving small regions (of
	less than 20 Mb) of the genome, resolution of closely spaced aberrations
	and linking ratio changes to genomic/genetic markers. Therefore,
	more laborious locus-by-locus techniques have been required for
	higher resolution studies. Hybridization to an array of mapped sequences
	instead of metaphase chromosomes could overcome the limitations
	of conventional CGH (ref. 6) if adequate performance could be achieved.
	Copy number would be related to the test/reference fluorescence
	ratio on the array targets, and genomic resolution could be determined
	by the map distance between the targets, or by the length of the
	cloned DNA segments. We describe here our implementation of array
	CGH. We demonstrate its ability to measure copy number with high
	precision in the human genome, and to analyse clinical specimens
	by obtaining new information on chromosome 20 aberrations in breast
	cancer.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are currently a number of competing techniques for
	low-level processing of oligonucleotide array data. The choice of
	technique has profound effect on subsequent statistical analyses,
	but there is no method to assess whether a particular technique
	is appropriate for a specific data set, without reference to external
	data. RESULTS: We analyzed coregulation between genes in order to
	detect insufficient normalization between arrays, where coregulation
	is measured in terms of statistical correlation. In a large collection
	of genes, a random pair of genes should have on average zero correlation,
	hence allowing a correlation test. For all data sets that we evaluated,
	and the three most commonly used low-level processing procedures
	including MAS5, RMA and MBEI, the housekeeping-gene normalization
	failed the test. For a real clinical data set, RMA and MBEI showed
	significant correlation for absent genes. We also found that a second
	round of normalization on the probe set level improved normalization
	significantly throughout. CONCLUSION: Previous evaluation of low-level
	processing in the literature has been limited to artificial spike-in
	and mixture data sets. In the absence of a known gold-standard,
	the correlation criterion allows us to assess the appropriateness
	of low-level processing of a specific data set and the success of
	normalization for subsets of genes.},

	defects as well as cancer and often constitute the key in identification
	of novel disease related genes. Classical cytogenetic methods are
	limited in resolution and dependent on highly skilled labour, while
	methods with higher resolution, based on molecular cytogenetics
	approaches such as matrix CGH, are not widely available. METHODS:
	We have developed and evaluated a method we term "molecular karyotyping",
	using readily available and easy to handle oligonucleotide arrays
	originally designed for parallel genomewide analysis of over 10,000
	SNPs. We show that we can easily and reliably detect unbalanced
	chromosomal aberrations of various sizes from as little as 250 ng
	of DNA on a single microarray, based on fluorescence intensity information
	from clusters of SNPs. RESULTS: We determined the resolution of
	this method through analysis of 20 trios with 21 previously confirmed
	subtle aberrations sizing between 0.2 and 13 Mb. Duplications and
	deletions of at least 5 Mb in size were reliably detectable, but
	detection of smaller aberrations was dependent on the number of
	SNPs they contained, thus seven of 10 different deletions analysed,
	with sizes ranging from 0.2 to 3.7 Mb, were not detectable due to
	insufficient SNP densitiy in the respective region. CONCLUSIONS:
	Deduction of reliable cut off levels for array peaks in our series
	of well characterised patients allows the use of the GeneChip Mapping
	10K SNP array for performing rapid molecular karyotyping from small
	amounts of DNA for the detection of even subtle deletions and duplications
	with high sensitivity and specificity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quality-control is an important issue in the analysis
	of gene expression microarrays. One type of problem is regional
	bias, in which one region of a chip shows artifactually high or
	low intensities (or ratios in a two-channel array) relative to the
	majority of the chip. Current practice in quality assessment for
	microarrays does not address regional biases. RESULTS: We present
	methods implemented in R for visualizing regional biases and other
	spatial artifacts on spotted microarrays and Affymetrix chips. We
	also propose a statistical index to quantify regional bias and investigate
	its typical distribution on spotted and Affymetrix arrays. We demonstrate
	that notable regional biases occur on both Affymetrix and spotted
	arrays and that they can make a significant difference in the case
	of spotted microarray results. Although strong biases are also seen
	at the level of individual probes on Affymetrix chips, the gene
	expression measures are less affected, especially when the RMA method
	is used to summarize intensities for the probe sets. A web application
	program for visualization and quantitation of regional bias is provided
	at http://www.discover.nci.nih.gov/affytools. CONCLUSION: Researchers
	should visualize and measure the regional biases and should estimate
	their impact on gene expression measurements obtained. Here, we
	(i) introduce pictorial visualizations of the spatial biases; (ii)
	present for Affymetrix chips a useful resolution of the biases into
	two components, one related to background, the other to intensity
	scale factor; (iii) introduce a single parameter to reflect the
	global bias present across an array. We also examine the pattern
	distribution of such biases and conclude that algorithms based on
	smoothing are unlikely to compensate adequately for them.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microarray-based measurement of mRNA abundance assumes
	a linear relationship between the fluorescence intensity and the
	dye concentration. In reality, however, the calibration curve can
	be nonlinear. RESULTS: By scanning a microarray scanner calibration
	slide containing known concentrations of fluorescent dyes under
	18 PMT gains, we were able to evaluate the differences in calibration
	characteristics of Cy5 and Cy3. First, the calibration curve for
	the same dye under the same PMT gain is nonlinear at both the high
	and low intensity ends. Second, the degree of nonlinearity of the
	calibration curve depends on the PMT gain. Third, the two PMTs (for
	Cy5 and Cy3) behave differently even under the same gain. Fourth,
	the background intensity for the Cy3 channel is higher than that
	for the Cy5 channel. The impact of such characteristics on the accuracy
	and reproducibility of measured mRNA abundance and the calculated
	ratios was demonstrated. Combined with simulation results, we provided
	explanations to the existence of ratio underestimation, intensity-dependence
	of ratio bias, and anti-correlation of ratios in dye-swap replicates.
	We further demonstrated that although Lowess normalization effectively
	eliminates the intensity-dependence of ratio bias, the systematic
	deviation from true ratios largely remained. A method of calculating
	ratios based on concentrations estimated from the calibration curves
	was proposed for correcting ratio bias. CONCLUSION: It is preferable
	to scan microarray slides at fixed, optimal gain settings under
	which the linearity between concentration and intensity is maximized.
	Although normalization methods improve reproducibility of microarray
	measurements, they appear less effective in improving accuracy.},

	gene expression during nephrogenesis. Group 1 consisted of genes
	with very high expression in the early embryonic kidney, many with
	roles in protein translation and DNA replication. Group 2 consisted
	of genes that peaked in midembryogenesis and contained many transcripts
	specifying proteins of the extracellular matrix. Many additional
	transcripts allied with groups 1 and 2 had known or proposed roles

	Homeobox protein A11, timeless, pleiotrophin, HGF, HNF3, BMP4, TGF-alpha,
	TGF-beta2, IGF-II, met, FGF7, BMP4, and ganglioside-GD3. Group 3
	consisted of transcripts that peaked in the neonatal period and
	contained a number of retrotransposon RNAs. Group 4 contained genes
	that steadily increased in relative expression levels throughout
	development, including many genes involved in energy metabolism
	and transport. Group 5 consisted of genes with relatively low levels
	of expression throughout embryogenesis but with markedly higher
	levels in the adult kidney; this group included a heterogeneous
	mix of transporters, detoxification enzymes, and oxidative stress
	genes. The data suggest that the embryonic kidney is committed to
	cellular proliferation and morphogenesis early on, followed sequentially
	by extracellular matrix deposition and acquisition of markers of
	terminal differentiation. The neonatal burst of retrotransposon
	mRNA was unexpected and may play a role in a stress response associated

	Methods for learning linear models can be seen as a special case

	a continuous optimization framework based on robust M-estimation.
	The framework applies to a variety of linear learning problems in
	computer vision including eigen-analysis and structure from motion.
	Several synthetic and natural examples are used to develop and illustrate

	The present study attempted to correlate genomic alterations (loss
	of heterozygosity; LOH) with subclasses of breast cancers having
	distinct gene expression signatures. Hierarchical clustering of
	expression array data from 89 invasive breast cancers identified
	four major expression subclasses. Thirty-four of these cases representative
	of the four subclasses were microdissected and allelotyped using
	genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism detection arrays (Affymetrix,
	Inc.). LOH was determined by comparing tumor and normal single nucleotide
	polymorphism allelotypes. A newly developed statistical tool was
	used to determine the chromosomal regions of frequent LOH. We found
	that breast cancers were highly heterogeneous, with the proportion
	of LOH ranging widely from 0.3\% to >60\% of heterozygous markers.
	The most common sites of LOH were on 17p, 17q, 16q, 11q, and 14q,
	sites reported in previous LOH studies. Signature LOH events were
	discovered in certain expression subclasses. Unique regions of LOH
	on 5q and 4p marked a subclass of breast cancers with "basal-like"
	expression profiles, distinct from other subclasses. LOH on 1p and
	16q occurred preferentially in a subclass of estrogen receptor-positive
	breast cancers. Finding unique LOH patterns in different groups
	of breast cancer, in part defined by expression signatures, adds
	confidence to newer schemes of molecular classification. Furthermore,
	exclusive association between biological subclasses and restricted
	LOH events provides rationale to search for targeted genes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microarray data are subject to multiple sources of variation,
	of which biological sources are of interest whereas most others
	are only confounding. Recent work has identified systematic sources
	of variation that are intensity-dependent and non-linear in nature.
	Systematic sources of variation are not limited to the differing
	properties of the cyanine dyes Cy(5) and Cy(3) as observed in cDNA
	arrays, but are the general case for both oligonucleotide microarray
	(Affymetrix GeneChips) and cDNA microarray data. Current normalization
	techniques are most often linear and therefore not capable of fully
	correcting for these effects. RESULTS: We present here a simple
	and robust non-linear method for normalization using array signal
	distribution analysis and cubic splines. These methods compared
	favorably to normalization using robust local-linear regression
	(lowess). The application of these methods to oligonucleotide arrays
	reduced the relative error between replicates by 5-10\% compared
	with a standard global normalization method. Application to cDNA
	arrays showed improvements over the standard method and over Cy(3)-Cy(5)
	normalization based on dye-swap replication. In addition, a set
	of known differentially regulated genes was ranked higher by the
	t-test. In either cDNA or Affymetrix technology, signal-dependent
	bias was more than ten times greater than the observed print-tip
	or spatial effects. CONCLUSIONS: Intensity-dependent normalization
	is important for both high-density oligonucleotide array and cDNA
	array data. Both the regression and spline-based methods described
	here performed better than existing linear methods when assessed
	on the variability of replicate arrays. Dye-swap normalization was
	less effective at Cy(3)-Cy(5) normalization than either regression
	or spline-based methods alone.},

	Image analysis is an important aspect of microarray experiments,
	one that can have a potentially large impact on subsequent analyses
	such as clustering or the identification of differentially expressed
	genes. This article reviews a number of existing image analysis
	approaches for cDNA microarray experiments and proposes new addressing,
	segmentation, and background correction methods for extracting information
	from microarray scanned images. The segmentation component uses
	a seeded region growing algorithm which makes provision for spots
	of different shapes and sizes. The background estimation approach
	is based on an image analysis technique known as morphological opening.
	These new image analysis procedures are implemented in a software
	package named Spot, built on the R environment for statistical computing.
	The statistical properties of the different segmentation and background
	adjustment methods are examined using microarray data from a study
	of lipid metabolism in mice. It is shown that in some cases background
	adjustment can substantially reduce the precisionthat is, increase
	the variabilityof low-intensity spot values. In contrast, the choice
	of segmentation procedure has a smaller impact. The comparison further
	suggests that seeded region growing segmentation with morphological
	background correction provides precise and accurate estimates of

	In this and other technologies, a number of critical steps are required
	to convert the raw measures into the data relied upon by biologists
	and clinicians. These data manipulations, referred to as preprocessing,
	have enormous influence on the quality of the ultimate measurements
	and studies that rely upon them. Many researchers have previously
	demonstrated that the use of modern statistical methodology can
	substantially improve accuracy and precision of gene expression
	measurements, relative to ad-hoc procedures introduced by designers
	and manufacturers of the technology. However, further substantial
	improvements are possible. Microarrays are now being used to measure
	diverse high genomic endpoints including yeast mutant representations,
	the presence of SNPs, presence of deletions/insertions, and protein
	binding sites by chromatin immunoprecipitation (known as ChIP-chip).
	In each case, the genomic units of measurement are relatively short
	DNA molecules referred to as probes. Without appropriate understanding
	of the bias and variance of these measurements, biological inferences
	based upon probe analysis will be compromised. Standard operating
	procedure for microarray researchers is to use preprocessed data
	as the starting point for the statistical analyses that produce
	reported results. This has prevented many researchers from carefully
	considering their choice of preprocessing methodology. Furthermore,
	the fact that the preprocessing step greatly affects the stochastic
	properties of the final statistical summaries is ignored. In this

	be addressed, e.g., on which level should the normalization be performed:
	On the level of feature intensities or on the level of expression
	indexes? Should all features/expression indexes be used or can we
