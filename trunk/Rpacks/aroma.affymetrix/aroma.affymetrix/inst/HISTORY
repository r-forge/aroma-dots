Package: aroma.affymetrix
=========================

Version: 0.3.5 [2007-01-22]
o BUG FIX: Somehow hgChromosomes.txt disappeared from the last
  versions of the package. Readded.
o Now fromChipType() of DChipGenomeInformation recognized 
  the Mapping10K_Xba142 genotype information files too, meaning
  getGenotypeInformation() of AffymetrixCdfFile will also 
  recognize it.  Same updates were done for dChip SNP 
  information files.
o Now the default sample of the ChromosomeExplorer is the first
  sample (and not the 8th, which was left in there while I was
  debugging).  The default chromosome is 1 (not 21st).

Version: 0.3.4 [2007-01-20]
o Passes R CMD check on v2.4.1.
o BUG FIX: When trying to load CDFs (and in some other cases
  too), the GLAD package (and some other packages) wer loaded
  although they are only "suggested" packages.  This was due
  to how the constructor of some classes were implemented.

Version: 0.3.3 [2007-01-17]
o Passes R CMD check on v2.4.0.
o BUG FIX: For some reason does clearCache() of Object not
  clear out all cached fields. Until I've figured out what
  is wrong, I've added explicit clearCache() to classes using
  cached fields.
o The FragmentLengthNormalization class forgot to clear cache
  after cloning input data set.  This caused the output data
  set to get the same average file as the input data set.
o Added classes QualityAssessmentModel, QualityAssessmentSet,
  and QualityAssessmentFile.
o Now createMonoCell() create the CDF in chunks, that is, 
  in constant memory.
o Now plot() of GladModel gets the default 'hgChromosomes.txt' 
  of the package if it can't be found in annotations/.
o BUG FIX: createMonoCell() of AffymetrixCdfFile would give
  an errounous mono-cell CDF file due to a recent change.

Version: 0.3.2 [2007-01-07]
o Package pass R CMD check v2.4.0.
o Tested the package from scratch analysis 19 Mapping250K_Nsp
  and 16 Mapping250K_Sty (15 in common) for total copy-number
  analysis. Steps involved: quantile normalization, RMA 
  probe-level modelling, PCR fragment-length normalization,
  and combined GLAD modelling.  This was done in WinXP Pro
  on an IBM X61 with 1.5GB RAM.  Memory usage peaked at
  approximately 1GB.
o Some optimization of what is cached in memory and what
  is cached on file.  Only for some data classes for now.
o Replaced old GladModel with new MultiGladModel, which
  is now named GladModel.
o Added AffineCnPlm for completeness.
o The ChromosomeExplorer class now generates a complete
  working ChromosomeExplorer web page.
o WORKAROUND: If 'affy' is loaded after aroma.affymetrix,
  which happens when loading 'affyPLM', affy will overload
  the generic function plotDensity() with a regular function
  breaking that method in aroma.affymetrix. The solution
  is to make sure 'affy' is always loaded before, which was done
  by adding 'affy' to 'Depends:' in DESCRIPTION.  We have the
  same problem with the 'oligo' package, which is required by
  the CrlmmModel class.  However, for now, we leave that package
  under 'Suggests:'.

Version: 0.3.2 [2007-01-06]
o Major changes.
o Renamed all Preprocessing classes to Transform classes.
o Introduced trial version of a top-level Model class in 
  order to minimize repeated code.
o Made several methods "private" in order to hide them
  form the HTML help tables.  Developers should rely on
  source code and Rdoc comments for now.

Version: 0.3.1 [2007-01-05]
o Package pass R CMD check v2.4.0 (with one warning I suspect
  is a bug in R CMD check).
o Some code was moved to 'affxparser' (v1.7.3) so it is 
  recommended to update to that as soon as it is available
  on the Bioconductor servers.
o Added initial code for PLASQ, but more is still needed.
o In addition to default "PM only" model, ProbeLevelModel:s now
  also handles "PM-MM" models.  Note that PM-MM might give a 
  non-positive value.  The multiplicate MbeiPlm handles this,
  but also the log-additive RmaPlm where such values become NAs.


Version: 0.3.0 [2006-12-20]
o Made fitGlad() for classes CnChipEffectFile and CnChipEffectSet
  deprecated.  Use the GladModel class instead.


Version: 0.3.0 [2006-12-08]
o Major updates. See below.
o Change in directory structures.  Now all probe-level data
  is outputted to probeData/, and all PLM data to plmData/.
  Data from the GladModel is stored to gladData/.  Data sets
  with the same name processed in different ways will be 
  distinguishable by their tags.
o Pre-processing methods have now been split up in two major
  classes, the ProbePreprocessing and ChipEffectPreprocessing
  (both inheriting from the Preprocessing class) to indicate
  that they operate on probe-level and chip-effect data, 
  respectively. All ProbePreprocessing classes output data 
  to the probeData/ directory, and the ChipEffectPreprocessing
  class to the plmData/ directory.
o ProbePreprocessing classes:
  QuantileNormalization replaces QuantileNormalizer. 
  AlleleCrosstalkCalibration replaces AlleleCrosstalkCalibrator.
  PcrProbeCalibration corrects for PCR effects due to oligo 
  sequence and SNP fragment lengths, cf. CRLMM.
Adapted from oligo.
o ChipEffectPreprocessing classes:
  FragmentLengthNormalization to normalize for PCR fragment-
  length effects after PLM, cf. CNAG.
o Added the PlatformDesign class which provides an interface to 
  a platform-design package without loading the package.  This
  is used for instance by the PcrProbeCalibration class.


Version: 0.2.6 [2006-12-07]
o The recently added methods below makes it possible to store
  FeatureSet data to CEL files, which will further simplify 
  bridging the aroma.affymetrix and the oligo package.
o Added protected importFeatureSet() to import probe signals
  from a single-sample oligo::FeatureSet object. 
o Added static method createBlankSet() to AffymetrixCelSet
  to create a set of blank CEL files.
o BUG FIX: The internal cache for readUnits() of ChipEffectFile 
  classes was not sensitive to neither class nor parameters
  specific to subclasses.
o Added trial version of writeWig() to CnChipEffectSet to export
  log2 copy numbers to the UCSC Genome Browser.


Version: 0.2.5 [2006-11-22]
o Package pass R CMD check.
o Added GladModel.  Now it is fairly simple to estimate total 
  copy numbers from Affymetrix 10K, 100K and 500K data sets.
o Added support for tags to most classes.
o Made encode() and decode() of ParameterCelFile approx 2-3 times
  faster by skipping the encode-/decodeUnit() step and instead
  call the encode and decode functions directly.  This will
  speed up the updating of chip-effect files about two times.
o Added R.native to the list of suggested packages. The reason
  for this is that getAverageFile() of AffymetrixCelSet is
  using rowMedians(x, na.rm) of R.native.  The version in Biobase
  does not handle missing values.  In case R.native is not
  installed, apply() and median() are used.
o Added SE estimates in RmaPlm from new affyPLM.


Version: 0.2.4 [2006-10-28]
o Added more Rdoc comments.


Version: 0.2.3 [2006-10-23]
o Added gcrma background correction.  Contributed by Ken Simpson,
  WEHI, Melbourne.
o Added extractAffyBatch() to AffymetrixCelSet extracting data
  applicable to methods in the affy package.
o Added extractSnpFeatureSet() to AffymetrixCelSet and 
  extractSnpQSet() to SnpChipEffectSet extracting data applicable 
  to methods in the oligo package.
o Added trial versions of AffymetrixSnpCdfFile, GenotypeCallFile,
  GenotypeCallSet etc.


Version: 0.2.2 [2006-09-16]
o Added basic support for dChip genome information.  It is good
  enough though to work with the 100K and 500K SNP chips.
o Package now passes R CMD check.  Some cheating were done though,
  because methods with missing Rdoc where put as \alias{}:es in
  one place.


Version: 0.2.1 [2006-09-07]
o Another big change in how classes are named.


Version: 0.2.0 [2006-08-25]
o Have done a big redesign of the package. There are now also
  some basic model fitting algorithm available.  Probe-affinity
  estimates are stored in CEL files. Soon chip effects will also
  be stored in CEL files using customized CDF files that we very
  can write using the affxparser package.


Version: 0.1.5 [2006-07-2x]
o BUG FIX: The 'outPath' argument of normalizeQuantile() in the 
  AffymetrixDataset class was not recognized.


Version: 0.1.4 [2006-07-24]
o Important breakthrough: We've update affxparser v1.5.3 with a working
  updateCel() function to update CEL v4 files.  This makes it possible
  to write normalized probe-level data as CEL files, e.g. now you can
  use normalizeQuantile(..., format="cel") to generate CEL files.  Note
  that this only works with binary CEL files (v4); ASCII CEL files (v3)
  and Calvin CEL files (upcoming binary format) is not supported.
o Now findCdf() throws an exception if CDF file is not found.


Version: 0.1.3 [2006-07-05]
o BUG FIX/WORKAROUND: Currently the affxparser code crash R if the file 
  is not a valid CEL file.  The best we can do now is to test that the
  filename has suffix *.CEL.  Thanks Ken Simpson, WEHI, Melbourne for
  pointing this out.


Version: 0.1.2 [2006-06-13]
o Made the static fromFile() and fromFiles() methods more
  generic such that it is easier to subset the different
  classes, e.g. for SNP chip classes.


Version: 0.1.1 [2006-05-30]
o Cleaned up the API and the Rd help.
o "Finalized" the quantile normalization.


Version: 0.1.0 [2006-01-11]
o Created.
