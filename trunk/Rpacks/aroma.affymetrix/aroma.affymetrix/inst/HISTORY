Package: aroma.affymetrix
=========================

Version: 0.2.2 [2006-09-16]
o Added basic support for dChip genome information.  It is good
  enough though to work with the 100K and 500K SNP chips.
o Package now passes R CMD check.  Some cheating were done though,
  because methods with missing Rdoc where put as \alias{}:es in
  one place.

Version: 0.2.1 [2006-09-07]
o Another big change in how classes are named.

Version: 0.2.0 [2006-08-25]
o Have done a big redesign of the package. There are now also
  some basic model fitting algorithm available.  Probe-affinity
  estimates are stored in CEL files. Soon chip effects will also
  be stored in CEL files using customized CDF files that we very
  can write using the affxparser package.

Version: 0.1.5 [2006-07-2x]
o BUG FIX: The 'outPath' argument of normalizeQuantile() in the 
  AffymetrixDataset class was not recognized.

Version: 0.1.4 [2006-07-24]
o Important breakthrough: We've update affxparser v1.5.3 with a working
  updateCel() function to update CEL v4 files.  This makes it possible
  to write normalized probe-level data as CEL files, e.g. now you can
  use normalizeQuantile(..., format="cel") to generate CEL files.  Note
  that this only works with binary CEL files (v4); ASCII CEL files (v3)
  and Calvin CEL files (upcoming binary format) is not supported.
o Now findCdf() throws an exception if CDF file is not found.

Version: 0.1.3 [2006-07-05]
o BUG FIX/WORKAROUND: Currently the affxparser code crash R if the file 
  is not a valid CEL file.  The best we can do now is to test that the
  filename has suffix *.CEL.  Thanks Ken Simpson, WEHI, Melbourne for
  pointing this out.

Version: 0.1.2 [2006-06-13]
o Made the static fromFile() and fromFiles() methods more
  generic such that it is easier to subset the different
  classes, e.g. for SNP chip classes.

Version: 0.1.1 [2006-05-30]
o Cleaned up the API and the Rd help.
o "Finalized" the quantile normalization.

Version: 0.1.0 [2006-01-11]
o Created.
