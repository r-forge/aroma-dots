Package: aroma.affymetrix
=========================

Version: 0.2.5 [2006-11-22]
o Package pass R CMD check.
o Added GladModel.  Now it is fairly simple to estimate total 
  copy numbers from Affymetrix 10K, 100K and 500K data sets.
o Added support for tags to most classes.
o Made encode() and decode() of ParameterCelFile approx 2-3 times
  faster by skipping the encode-/decodeUnit() step and instead
  call the encode and decode functions directly.  This will
  speed up the updating of chip-effect files about two times.
o Added R.native to the list of suggested packages. The reason
  for this is that getAverageFile() of AffymetrixCelSet is
  using rowMedians(x, na.rm) of R.native.  The version in Biobase
  does not handle missing values.  In case R.native is not
  installed, apply() and median() are used.
o Added SE estimates in RmaPlm from new affyPLM.

Version: 0.2.4 [2006-10-28]
o Added more Rdoc comments.

Version: 0.2.3 [2006-10-23]
o Added gcrma background correction.  Contributed by Ken Simpson,
  WEHI, Melbourne.
o Added extractAffyBatch() to AffymetrixCelSet extracting data
  applicable to methods in the affy package.
o Added extractSnpFeatureSet() to AffymetrixCelSet and 
  extractSnpQSet() to SnpChipEffectSet extracting data applicable 
  to methods in the oligo package.
o Added trial versions of AffymetrixSnpCdfFile, GenotypeCallFile,
  GenotypeCallSet etc.

Version: 0.2.2 [2006-09-16]
o Added basic support for dChip genome information.  It is good
  enough though to work with the 100K and 500K SNP chips.
o Package now passes R CMD check.  Some cheating were done though,
  because methods with missing Rdoc where put as \alias{}:es in
  one place.

Version: 0.2.1 [2006-09-07]
o Another big change in how classes are named.

Version: 0.2.0 [2006-08-25]
o Have done a big redesign of the package. There are now also
  some basic model fitting algorithm available.  Probe-affinity
  estimates are stored in CEL files. Soon chip effects will also
  be stored in CEL files using customized CDF files that we very
  can write using the affxparser package.

Version: 0.1.5 [2006-07-2x]
o BUG FIX: The 'outPath' argument of normalizeQuantile() in the 
  AffymetrixDataset class was not recognized.

Version: 0.1.4 [2006-07-24]
o Important breakthrough: We've update affxparser v1.5.3 with a working
  updateCel() function to update CEL v4 files.  This makes it possible
  to write normalized probe-level data as CEL files, e.g. now you can
  use normalizeQuantile(..., format="cel") to generate CEL files.  Note
  that this only works with binary CEL files (v4); ASCII CEL files (v3)
  and Calvin CEL files (upcoming binary format) is not supported.
o Now findCdf() throws an exception if CDF file is not found.

Version: 0.1.3 [2006-07-05]
o BUG FIX/WORKAROUND: Currently the affxparser code crash R if the file 
  is not a valid CEL file.  The best we can do now is to test that the
  filename has suffix *.CEL.  Thanks Ken Simpson, WEHI, Melbourne for
  pointing this out.

Version: 0.1.2 [2006-06-13]
o Made the static fromFile() and fromFiles() methods more
  generic such that it is easier to subset the different
  classes, e.g. for SNP chip classes.

Version: 0.1.1 [2006-05-30]
o Cleaned up the API and the Rd help.
o "Finalized" the quantile normalization.

Version: 0.1.0 [2006-01-11]
o Created.
