Package: aroma.affymetrix
=========================

Version: 0.1.5 [2006-07-2x]
o BUG FIX: The 'outPath' argument of normalizeQuantile() in the 
  AffymetrixDataset class was not recognized.

Version: 0.1.4 [2006-07-24]
o Important breakthrough: We've update affxparser v1.5.3 with a working
  updateCel() function to update CEL v4 files.  This makes it possible
  to write normalized probe-level data as CEL files, e.g. now you can
  use normalizeQuantile(..., format="cel") to generate CEL files.  Note
  that this only works with binary CEL files (v4); ASCII CEL files (v3)
  and Calvin CEL files (upcoming binary format) is not supported.
o Now findCdf() throws an exception if CDF file is not found.

Version: 0.1.3 [2006-07-05]
o BUG FIX/WORKAROUND: Currently the affxparser code crash R if the file 
  is not a valid CEL file.  The best we can do now is to test that the
  filename has suffix *.CEL.  Thanks Ken Simpson, WEHI, Melbourne for
  pointing this out.

Version: 0.1.2 [2006-06-13]
o Made the static fromFile() and fromFiles() methods more
  generic such that it is easier to subset the different
  classes, e.g. for SNP chip classes.

Version: 0.1.1 [2006-05-30]
o Cleaned up the API and the Rd help.
o "Finalized" the quantile normalization.

Version: 0.1.0 [2006-01-11]
o Created.
