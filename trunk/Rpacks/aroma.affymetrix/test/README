ABOUT TEST SCRIPTS
------------------

DESCRIPTION
Most of the script in this directory is test scripts used for developing
the package.  


WHERE TO PUT EXAMPLE DATA
Note that they all search for data in directory chip_data/<chiptype>/, 
e.g. chip_data/Hind/.  The CDF files are always found through findCdf()
in the affxparser package.  

On *nix systems you can create a soft link to the chip_data/ directory,
and on Windows you can use Windows Shortcuts.
