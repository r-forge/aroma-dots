DESCRIPTION
Most of the script in this directory is test scripts used for developing
the package.  

WHERE TO PUT EXAMPLE DATA
Note that they all search for data in directory cel/<chiptype>/, e.g. 
cel/Hind/.  The CDF files are found trough affxparser::findCdf().
On *nix systems you may create a soft link to any directory containing
the CEL data.  On Windows there are no soft link, but instead you may 
use Windows Shortcuts, because the aroma.affymetrix package recognizes
such.  Thus, you do not have to copy data here to run these scripts.
