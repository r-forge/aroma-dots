ABOUT TEST SCRIPTS
------------------

DESCRIPTION
Most of the script in this directory is test scripts used for developing
the package.  


WHERE TO PUT EXAMPLE DATA
Note that they all search for raw data in raw/<data set>/<chip type>/, 
e.g. raw/Affymetrix_2006-500k/Mapping250K_Nsp/. The CDF files are always
found through findCdf() in the affxparser package.  

On *nix systems you can create a soft link to the raw/ directory,
and on Windows you can use Windows Shortcuts.
