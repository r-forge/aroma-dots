Description: This package provides memory-efficient methods to perform basic analysis such as normalization and probeset summarization on Affymetrix data.  An AffymetrixDataset object defines a set of Affymetrix data files (typically CEL files) on the file system for which there are methods to access the data by probes or probesets across arrays.  The data is accessed as if it is in memory, but are internally read from file on request.  With this approach there is in theory no limitation in the number of arrays a data set has, e.g. we have quantile normalized ninety 100K SNP chips using only 150Mb RAM.
