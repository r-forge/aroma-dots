Package: aroma.affxparser
=========================

Version: 0.1.3 [2006-06-19]
o Forgot to use autoload("setMethodS3", package="R.oo") etc.
  Packaged would not install on Linux.

Version: 0.1.2 [2006-03-18]
o Added updateApdUnits(). 
o Now all probe indices are not longer zero-based but one-based.
  However, there is still an option to change this to zero-based
  indices again by using argument 'indexOffset=0'.  This option
  might be remove in the future, because zero-based indices are
  really confusing in R.

Version: 0.1.1 [2006-03-14]
o There is now a quite large set of methods to process APD files.
o All of the methods to re-arrange CDF structures and to create
  cell-index maps have been moved to the affxparser package.

Version: 0.1.0 [2006-02-23]
o Created.
